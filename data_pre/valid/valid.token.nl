30665	Checks whether a given key is contained in this dictionary .
20330	Computes key.hashCode ( ) and spreads ( XORs ) higher bits of hash to lower . Because the table uses power-of-two masking , sets of hashes that vary only in bits above the current mask will always collide . ( Among known examples are sets of Float keys holding consecutive whole numbers in small tables . ) So we apply a transform that spreads the impact of higher bits downward . There is a tradeoff between speed , utility , and quality of bit-spreading . Because many common sets of hashes are already reasonably distributed ( so do n't benefit from spreading ) , and because we use trees to handle large sets of collisions in bins , we just XOR some shifted bits in the cheapest possible way to reduce systematic lossage , as well as to incorporate impact of the highest bits that would otherwise never be used in index calculations because of table bounds .

Therefore , it is necessary to always return < code > true < /code > to indicate the user has not failed authentication. < /p > < p > There are two cases : < /p > < ul > < li > without SingleSignon : a Session instance does not yet exist and there is no < code > auth-method < /code > to authenticate the user , so leave Request 's Principal as null . Note : AuthenticatorBase will later examine the security constraints to determine whether the resource is accessible by a user without a security Principal and Role ( i.e . unauthenticated ) . < /li > < li > with SingleSignon : if the user has already authenticated via another container ( using its own login configuration ) , then associate this Session with the SSOEntry so it inherits the already-established security Principal and associated Roles . Note : This particular session will become a full member of the SingleSignOnEntry Session collection and so will potentially keep the SSOE `` alive '' , even if all the other properly authenticated Sessions expire first ... until it expires too . < /li > < /ul >

1262	This method is called by the OpenAMSessionTokenServerInterceptor and OpenAMSessionTokenClientInterceptor classes when determining whether to assert the TransportToken . The AbstractTokenInterceptor # assertTokens is called in all four JASPI phases . The isTLSInUse implemented in the AbstractTokenInterceptor does not work in the secure-request or validate-response phases - it seems to work exclusively in the validate-request case . The OpenAMSessionToken interceptors need to assert the TransportToken in all four cases to prevent FINE warning messages concerning an unasserted TransportToken , hence this override , which works in all cases . This override will also consult the superclass method . Note however , that there is no state in the outgoing message corresponding to `` http.scheme '' in the server egress message , so the validate-response is not able to assert the TransportToken , and thus the FINE message warning of an unasserted TransportToken will appear . This is really the domain of the TransportBindingHandler ( see http : //cxf.547215.n5.nabble.com/Custom-SecurityPolicy-Assertions-and-the-Symmetric-binding-td5754879.html for details ) , so we will have to live with this error message .
39072	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object . It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy ( ) to avoid resource leaks . Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid . Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST . It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained .
567	Indicates whether this entry contains the specified attribute .

37993	Helper method to check if a property is protected or not . We introduce a mechanism to protect certain `` core '' or `` internal '' properties from updates via remote SetProperty method of the SessionService . Allowing remote self-updates to session properties leads to a security vulnerability which allows unconstrained user impersonation or privilege elevation . See bug # 4814922 for more information protectedProperties contains a set of property names which can not be remotely updated . It is initially populated using static initializer . We also implemented an extra safety mechanism intended to protect from accidental reopening of this security hole in the future if a property name changes or new property is introduced without corresponding update of the static hardcoded list of protected properties below . This mechanism automatically adds any property to protectedProperties if it is set via local invocation of putProperty . However , some properties ( such as Locale and CharSet ) must be settable both locally and remotely . In order to make it configurable we use a second table called remotelyUpdateableProperties . Note that protectedProperties takes precedence over remotelyUpdateableProperties : remotelyUpdateableProperties will be consulted only if a property is not on the protectedProperties list already . The following tables defines the behavior of putProperty ( ) and putExternalProperty ( ) depending on whether property name is present in protectedProperties or remotelyUpdateableProperty list protectedProperties remotelyUpdateableProperties putProperty ( ) putExternalProperty ( ) in n/a sets value logs , does nothing out in sets value sets value out out sets value and sets value adds to protectedProperty

24202	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object . It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy ( ) to avoid resource leaks . Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid . Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST . It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained .

57196	The Android SSLSocket and SSLServerSocket implementations are based on a version of OpenSSL which includes support for RFC 4507 session tickets . When using session tickets , the server does not need to keep a cache mapping session IDs to SSL sessions for reuse . Instead , the client presents the server with a session ticket it received from the server earlier , which is an SSL session encrypted by the server 's secret key . Since in this case the server does not need to keep a cache , some tests may find different results depending on whether or not the session tickets are in use . These tests can use this function to determine if loopback SSL connections are expected to use session tickets and conditionalize their results appropriately .

33126	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object . It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy ( ) to avoid resource leaks . Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid . Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST . It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained .
33669	Returns an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map . The set is backed by the map , so changes to the map are reflected in the set , and vice-versa . If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress , the results of the iteration are undefined . The set supports element removal , which removes the corresponding mapping from the map , via the < tt > Iterator.remove < /tt > , < tt > Set.remove < /tt > , < tt > removeAll < /tt > , < tt > retainAll < /tt > , and < tt > clear < /tt > methods . It does not support the < tt > add < /tt > or < tt > addAll < /tt > methods . < p > < b > While the object returned by this method implements the < tt > Set < /tt > interface , it does < i > not < /i > obey < tt > Set 's < /tt > general contract . Like its backing map , the set returned by this method defines element equality as reference-equality rather than object-equality . This affects the behavior of its < tt > contains < /tt > , < tt > remove < /tt > , < tt > containsAll < /tt > , < tt > equals < /tt > , and < tt > hashCode < /tt > methods. < /b > < p > < b > The < tt > equals < /tt > method of the returned set returns < tt > true < /tt > only if the specified object is a set containing exactly the same object references as the returned set . The symmetry and transitivity requirements of the < tt > Object.equals < /tt > contract may be violated if the set returned by this method is compared to a normal set . However , the < tt > Object.equals < /tt > contract is guaranteed to hold among sets returned by this method. < /b > < p > The < tt > hashCode < /tt > method of the returned set returns the sum of the < i > identity hashcodes < /i > of the elements in the set , rather than the sum of their hashcodes . This is mandated by the change in the semantics of the < tt > equals < /tt > method , in order to enforce the general contract of the < tt > Object.hashCode < /tt > method among sets returned by this method .
12110	Checks that the entry 's objectClass contains 'referral ' and that the attribute 'ref ' is present .
14921	Decodes a quoted-printable object into its original form . Escaped characters are converted back to their original representation .

24695	Schedules the specified task for repeated < i > fixed-delay execution < /i > , beginning at the specified time . Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals , separated by the specified period . < p > In fixed-delay execution , each execution is scheduled relative to the actual execution time of the previous execution . If an execution is delayed for any reason ( such as garbage collection or other background activity ) , subsequent executions will be delayed as well . In the long run , the frequency of execution will generally be slightly lower than the reciprocal of the specified period ( assuming the system clock underlying < tt > Object.wait ( long ) < /tt > is accurate ) . As a consequence of the above , if the scheduled first time is in the past , it is scheduled for immediate execution . < p > Fixed-delay execution is appropriate for recurring activities that require `` smoothness . '' In other words , it is appropriate for activities where it is more important to keep the frequency accurate in the short run than in the long run . This includes most animation tasks , such as blinking a cursor at regular intervals . It also includes tasks wherein regular activity is performed in response to human input , such as automatically repeating a character as long as a key is held down .

The coordinate arrays and the data in them are left untouched but the number of points is reset to zero to mark the old vertex data as invalid and to start accumulating new vertex data at the beginning . All internally-cached data relating to the old vertices are discarded . Note that since the coordinate arrays from before the reset are reused , creating a new empty < code > Polygon < /code > might be more memory efficient than resetting the current one if the number of vertices in the new polygon data is significantly smaller than the number of vertices in the data from before the reset .
24076	Appends a line to the logs ( Details are ) section of the panel . The text will be preceded by a new line ( is similar to println ( ) ) .

24027	Pops the next element from the top of the stack
7998	Determines in which direction the next view lays . Consider the < code > View < /code > at index n. Typically the < code > View < /code > s are layed out from left to right , so that the < code > View < /code > to the EAST will be at index n + 1 , and the < code > View < /code > to the WEST will be at index n - 1 . In certain situations , such as with bidirectional text , it is possible that the < code > View < /code > to EAST is not at index n + 1 , but rather at index n - 1 , or that the < code > View < /code > to the WEST is not at index n - 1 , but index n + 1 . In this case this method would return true , indicating the < code > View < /code > s are layed out in descending order . < p > This will return true if the text is layed out right to left at position , otherwise false .

For example , a validating parser would use this callback to report the violation of a validity constraint . The default behaviour is to take no action. < /p > < p > The SAX parser must continue to provide normal parsing events after invoking this method : it should still be possible for the application to process the document through to the end . If the application can not do so , then the parser should report a fatal error even if the XML 1.0 recommendation does not require it to do so. < /p >
51087	Create an instance of AttributeValueElement

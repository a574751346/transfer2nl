55426	NOTE : the semantic of forName0 follows forName method . Returns the Class object associated with the class or interface with the given string name , using the given class loader . Given the fully qualified name for a class or interface ( in the same format returned by getName ) this method attempts to locate , load , and link the class or interface . The specified class loader is used to load the class or interface . If the parameter loader is null , the class is loaded through the bootstrap class loader . The class is initialized only if the initialize parameter is true and if it has not been initialized earlier . If name denotes a primitive type or void , an attempt will be made to locate a user-defined class in the unnamed package whose name is name . Therefore , this method can not be used to obtain any of the Class objects representing primitive types or void . If name denotes an array class , the component type of the array class is loaded but not initialized . For example , in an instance method the expression : Class.forName ( `` Foo '' ) is equivalent to : Class.forName ( `` Foo '' , true , this.getClass ( ) .getClassLoader ( ) ) private static native java.lang.Class forName0 ( java.lang.String , boolean , java.lang.ClassLoader ) throws java.lang.ClassNotFoundException ;

39823	With Field References -- . The analysis treats field references ( static and instance ) as common subexpressions ; however , we are more conservative when writing to a field , because the base of the field reference may be aliased . We also assume that the application is single-threaded or that the field references occur in a synchronized block . That is , we assume that a field may not be changed by other threads between two field references .

663	Naive Side Effect Tester -- Use a naive side effect analysis even if interprocedural information is available . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to true , Lazy Code Motion uses the conservative side effect information provided by the NaiveSideEffectTester class , even if interprocedural information about side effects is available . The naive side effect analysis is based solely on the information available locally about a statement . It assumes , for example , that any method call has the potential to write and read all instance and static fields in the program . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and Soot is in whole program mode , then Lazy Code Motion uses the side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester class . PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine which fields and statics may be written or read by a given statement . If whole program analysis is not performed , naive side effect information is used regardless of the setting of Naive Side Effect Tester .

If the target method uses its this parameter , a reference to the receiver object must be passed to the static copy of the target method . The verifier may complain if the declared type of the receiver parameter does not match the type implementing the target method . Say , for example , that Singer is an interface declaring the sing ( ) method and that the call graph shows all receiver objects at a particular call site , singer.sing ( ) ( with singer declared as a Singer ) are in fact Bird objects ( Bird being a class that implements Singer ) . The virtual call singer.sing ( ) is effectively replaced with the static call Bird.staticsing ( singer ) . Bird.staticsing ( ) may perform operations on its parameter which are only allowed on Birds , rather than Singers . The Insert Redundant Casts option inserts a cast of singer to the Bird type , to prevent complaints from the verifier .

The coordinate arrays and the data in them are left untouched but the number of points is reset to zero to mark the old vertex data as invalid and to start accumulating new vertex data at the beginning . All internally-cached data relating to the old vertices are discarded . Note that since the coordinate arrays from before the reset are reused , creating a new empty < code > Polyline2D < /code > might be more memory efficient than resetting the current one if the number of vertices in the new polyline data is significantly smaller than the number of vertices in the data from before the reset .

47971	Orders the IDC to move to a target rotation . This will set the rotational velocity to 0 . If setTargetRotation is called before a previous order has completed , the old order will be interrupted , and rotation will continue to the new order from whatever rotation it was at when interrupted . This method causes the IDC to sweep its rotation between its current rotation , and the target rotation . The target rotation is *NOT* globally relative ; it is instead relative to the rotation of its parent . Consider a carousel with a grandfather clock standing on it . The cabinet and the carousel would be represented with 1 IDC , and the hands of the clock would be each represented with an IDC . Let the carousel be still and at its default position , with the clock facing NORTH . When it is 12 o'clock , the hand will have zero rotation , and when it 's 6 o'clock , the hand will have half a turn around the NORTH axis . Using this method to order rotations between 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock will have the natural , desired effect . However , using setRotation or setRotationalVelocity can result in the hand not being flush with the face of the clock , since those methods are relative to the world .

In consumer thread pick up stripes from the queue , check if items are not duplicates with FullUniqueIndex and add them to index if necessary 4 . Increment count by number of added items 5 . Decrement count by number of items removed from the stripe . < p/ > The problem happens when # 2 is the end of the last scheduled task . At this point we fire notify . The count is still positive because we added something to the stripes . After this we pick items from the stripes and check on the FullUniqueIndex , but coincidentally the index already has all the elements and these are duplicates . So we add 0 at # 4 and deduct all items from the stripe at # 5 . The count=0 but we do not have any tasks to execute and nobody will notify the engine to get out of wait .

32878	Main working method . You may be surprised that here , just 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' is called . But internally , it works like this : AudioSystem.write ( ) contains a loop that is trying to read from the passed AudioInputStream . Since we have a special AudioInputStream that gets its data from a TargetDataLine , reading from the AudioInputStream leads to reading from the TargetDataLine . The data read this way is then written to the passed File . Before writing of audio data starts , a header is written according to the desired audio file type . Reading continues untill no more data can be read from the AudioInputStream . In our case , this happens if no more data can be read from the TargetDataLine . This , in turn , happens if the TargetDataLine is stopped or closed ( which implies stopping ) . ( Also see the comment above . ) Then , the file is closed and 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' returns .

49056	Guarding strategy -- Describes how to guard the program from unsound assumptions.. Using a reflection log is only sound for method executions that were logged . Executing the program differently may be unsound . Soot can insert guards at program points for which the reflection log contains no information . When these points are reached ( because the program is executed differently ) then the follwing will happen , depending on the value of this flag . ignore : no guard is inserted , the program executes normally but under unsound assumptions . print : the program prints a stack trace when reaching a porgram location that was not traced but continues to run . throw ( default ) : the program throws an Error instead .
7425	Terminates an open connection . Calling < code > abort < /code > results in : < ul > < li > The connection marked as closed < li > Closes any physical connection to the database < li > Releases resources used by the connection < li > Insures that any thread that is currently accessing the connection will either progress to completion or throw an < code > SQLException < /code > . < /ul > < p/ > Calling < code > abort < /code > marks the connection closed and releases any resources . Calling < code > abort < /code > on a closed connection is a no-op . < p/ > It is possible that the aborting and releasing of the resources that are held by the connection can take an extended period of time . When the < code > abort < /code > method returns , the connection will have been marked as closed and the < code > Executor < /code > that was passed as a parameter to abort may still be executing tasks to release resources . < p/ > This method checks to see that there is an < code > SQLPermission < /code > object before allowing the method to proceed . If a < code > SecurityManager < /code > exists and its < code > checkPermission < /code > method denies calling < code > abort < /code > , this method throws a < code > java.lang.SecurityException < /code > .

56072	Naive Side Effect Tester -- Use a naive side effect analysis even if interprocedural information is available . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to true , Busy Code Motion uses the conservative side effect information provided by the NaiveSideEffectTester class , even if interprocedural information about side effects is available . The naive side effect analysis is based solely on the information available locally about a statement . It assumes , for example , that any method call has the potential to write and read all instance and static fields in the program . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and Soot is in whole program mode , then Busy Code Motion uses the side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester class . PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine which fields and statics may be written or read by a given statement . If whole program analysis is not performed , naive side effect information is used regardless of the setting of Naive Side Effect Tester .

31374	GigaSpaces creates static resources implicitly when creating GigaSpaces components , such as remote/embedded space proxies . When using GigaSpaces outside of GigaSpaces containers ( GSC ) and processing unit , in some scenarios this resources should be cleaned up when no longer needed . This is relevant when hosting GigaSpaces components inside other application server which create a new class loader per deployment , which loads GigaSpaces libraries into that class loader each time . When this class loader is unloaded ( Due to undeployment of the application/service ) , this method should be called to cleanup the resources which were created implicitly . This method shutdown GigaSpaces runtime , once invoked the GigaSpaces runtime is destroyed and can not be reused in the current class loader which it was created in , as a result this is an irreversible process . This will only cleanup threads and resources which are created implicitly when using GigaSpaces runtime , it will not clean up resources the user has explicitly created such as space proxies , space instances and other components , this components needs to be destroyed explicitly by the creator . This should only be used when using GigaSpaces runtime outside of GigaSpaces containers ( GSC ) , and only if GigaSpaces libraries are loaded into new class loader on each deployment and not shared across multiple class loaders .

The only message m_consumers that can consume from a temporary destination are those created by the same connection that created the destination . Any message producer can send to the temporary destination . If you close the connection that a temporary destination belongs to , the destination is closed and its contents lost . You can use temporary destinations to implement a simple request/reply mechanism . If you create a temporary destination and specify it as the value of the JMSReplyTo message header field when you send a message , the consumer of the message can use the value of the JMSReplyTo field as the destination to which it sends a reply and can also reference the original request by setting the JMSCorrelationID header field of the reply message to the value of the JMSMessageID header field of the request .

It assumes , for example , that any method call has the potential to write and read all instance and static fields in the program . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and Soot is in whole program mode , then Lazy Code Motion uses the side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester class . PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine which fields and statics may be written or read by a given statement . If whole program analysis is not performed , naive side effect information is used regardless of the setting of Naive Side Effect Tester .

35264	MySQL is funny when it comes to timestamps and dates . More specifically , for a DDL statement like 'MYCOLUMN timestamp ( 3 ) ' : - MySQL 5.6.4+ has support for timestamps/dates with millisecond ( or smaller ) precision . The DDL above works and the data in the table will have millisecond precision - MySQL < 5.5.3 allows the DDL statement , but ignores it . The DDL above works but the data wo n't have millisecond precision - MySQL 5.5.3 < [ version ] < 5.6.4 gives and exception when using the DDL above . Also , the 5.5 and 5.6 branches of MySQL are both actively developed and patched . Hence , when doing auto-upgrade/creation of the Activiti tables , the default MySQL DDL file is used and all timestamps/datetimes are converted to not use the millisecond precision by string replacement done in the method below . If using the DDL files directly ( which is a sane choice in production env . ) , there is a distinction between MySQL version < 5.6 .

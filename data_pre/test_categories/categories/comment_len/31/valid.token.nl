73	BDD Nodes -- Number of BDD nodes to allocate ( 0=unlimited ) . This option specifies the number of BDD nodes to be used by the BDD backend . A value of 0 causes the backend to start with one million nodes , and allocate more as required . A value other than zero causes the backend to start with the specified size , and prevents it from ever allocating any more nodes .
100	Publishes the raw payload to a given topic . This is a blocking call so the calling thread is blocked until the publish operation is succeeded , failed , or the specified timeout has elapsed .
127	Samples integrity protection setting ( if any ) of the stream from which this instance is being deserialized and checks that valid values for this object have been read from the stream .
148	Returns whether a class with given qualified name resides directly in a package with given prefix ( as opposed to reside in a subpackage ) . < p/ > For example , < ul > < li > isDirectlyInPackage ( `` android.view.View '' , `` android.view .

227	Returns whether to show the 'permission blocked ' message . Majority of the time , that is warranted when the permission is either blocked per app or globally . But there are exceptions to this , so the sub-classes can overwrite .
230	Determines whether this controller can stop tracking the given job . The controller is no longer interested in a job once its time constraint is satisfied , and the job 's deadline is fulfilled - unlike other controllers a time constraint ca n't toggle back and forth .
233	Initialize a new Node backed by a node table . This method is used by the appropriate TupleManager instance , and should not be called directly by client code , unless by a client-supplied custom TupleManager .
239	Applies a supplemental hash function to a given hashCode , which defends against poor quality hash functions . This is critical because HashMap uses power-of-two length hash tables , that otherwise encounter collisions for hashCodes that do not differ in lower or upper bits .
244	Removes the named value from the environment . Supports the `` . '' ( dot ) syntax to access Map members and the `` [ ] '' ( bracket ) syntax to access List entries . This value is expanded , supporting the insertion of other environment values using the `` $ { } '' notation .
257	inserts a Jimple < code > Goto < /code > to < code > target , directly before < code > node < /code > in the given < code > unitChain < /code > . < br > As we use < code > JGoto < /code > the chain must contain Jimple-stmts .

268	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . This should only be used on AdapterView 's such as ListView as it just calls through to overScrollBy ( ) with the scrollRange = 0 . AdapterView 's do not have a scroll range ( i.e . getScrollY ( ) does n't work ) .
277	Records this update in the log file and forces the update to disk . The update is recorded by calling the client 's writeUpdate callback . This method must not be called until this log 's recover method has been invoked ( and completed ) .
293	Perform all memory check but do not perform eviction , instead returns true if eviction should be called this method will be used when loading cache in warm start with LRU mode in this case if the memory limit reached loading of entries from the persistence storage should be stopped instead of perform eviction and continue the cache loading .
304	Write a collection of IFallback objects to the short-term log DB table . In case that it detects that the DB is unavailable the incoming data will be temporarily stored into a fallback file , from which the data will be read and committed back to the DB as soon as it detects that the DB connection is up again
306	Resets variables maintaining the sum to zero . This method may be a useful alternative to creating a new adder , but is only effective if there are no concurrent updates . Because this method is intrinsically racy , it should only be used when it is known that no threads are concurrently updating .
308	Creates new Application defined by JMX connection and adds it to the Applications tree . Displays progress during application creation and opens an error dialog if creating the application failed . Note that even if the created application is n't persistent for another VisualVM sessions , the host created for this application will be restored .

344	< p > Encodes data from the given input stream and writes them in the given output stream . < /p > < p > The supplied input stream is read until its end is reached , but it 's not closed by this method . < /p > < p > The supplied output stream is nor flushed neither closed by this method . < /p >
349	Configures Gson to apply the passed in exclusion strategy during deserialization . If this method is invoked numerous times with different exclusion strategy objects then the exclusion strategies that were added will be applied as a disjunction rule . This means that if one of the added exclusion strategies suggests that a field ( or class ) should be skipped then that field ( or object ) is skipped during its deserialization .
362	Add a fixed view to appear at the top of the grid . If addHeaderView is called more than once , the views will appear in the order they were added . Views added using this call can take focus if they want . < p > NOTE : Call this before calling setAdapter . This is so HeaderGridView can wrap the supplied cursor with one that will also account for header views .
366	If the application decides to terminate parsing before the xml document is fully parsed , the application should call this method to free any resource allocated during parsing . For example , close all opened streams .
369	Get the contents of a < code > Reader < /code > as a character array . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > .

399	Adds the specified symbol to the symbol table and returns a reference to the unique symbol . If the symbol already exists , the previous symbol reference is returned instead , in order guarantee that symbol references remain unique .
401	Run an update cycle . An update cycle consists of : - gathering raw metrics - creating a new , minimal context - applying decorators against the current and previous values - storing the collection values as the most recent capture
402	A deep copy makes a distinct copy of each of the object 's fields , recursing through the entire graph of other objects referenced by the object being copied . Deep clone by serialize and deserialize the object and return the deserialized version . A deep copy/clone , assuming everything in the tree is serializable . NOTE : This method is very expensive ! , do n't use this method if you need performance .

417	Returns the Unicode Scalar Value ( 32-bit integer value ) for the character at < code > position < /code > . Note that this method avoids using the converter or doing String instatiation
418	Returns true if this task completed . Completion may be due to normal termination , an exception , or cancellation -- in all of these cases , this method will return true .
424	Closes the underlying < code > Reader < /code > quietly . This method is useful if you only want to process the first few lines of a larger file . If you do not close the iterator then the < code > Reader < /code > remains open . This method can safely be called multiple times .
428	This method notifies of the start of an entity . The document entity has the pseudo-name of `` [ xml ] '' the DTD has the pseudo-name of `` [ dtd ] '' parameter entity names start with ' % ' ; and general entities are just specified by their name .
430	Put or replace a long value . If the index is greater than the length of the JSONArray , then null elements will be added as necessary to pad it out .
433	Returns whether the loader has received requests to load custom views . Note that the custom view loading may not actually have succeeded ; this flag only records whether it was < b > requested < /b > . < p/ > This allows to efficiently only recreate when needed upon code change in the project .
438	Deletes a file , never throwing an exception . If file is a directory , delete it and all sub-directories . < p > The difference between File.delete ( ) and this method are : < ul > < li > A directory to be deleted does not have to be empty. < /li > < li > No exceptions are thrown when a file or directory can not be deleted. < /li > < /ul >
473	Returns the character at position < tt > pos < /tt > from the matched text . It is equivalent to yytext ( ) .charAt ( pos ) , but faster
486	Causes exit from in-progress event dispatch before the next currentTarget is selected . Replaces the preventBubble ( ) and preventCapture ( ) methods which were present in early drafts ; they may be reintroduced in future levels of the DOM .
506	Maximum zoom number the tiles source has available . If it is specified , the tiles on all zoom levels higher than maxNativeZoom will be loaded from maxNativeZoom level and auto-scaled . < /br > default null
520	Implicit Entry Points -- Include methods called implicitly by the VM as entry points . When this option is true , methods that are called implicitly by the VM are considered entry points of the call graph . When it is false , these methods are not considered entry points , leading to a possibly incomplete call graph .
522	Returns the set of all < code > Throwable < /code > s as the set of types that a < code > throw < /code > statement may throw implicitly , that is , the possible types of errors which might arise in the course of executing the < code > throw < /code > statement , rather than the type of the < code > throw < /code > 's operand .
523	Marks the service as shutting down , waiting if it is initializing , and throwing < code > NoSuchObjectException < /code > if it is already shutting down . Note that the < code > NoSuchObjectException < /code > will be wrapped in a < code > RemoteExceptionWrapper < /code > .

553	The < code > SelectionChangedEventAction < /code > implementation of this < code > ISelectionListener < /code > method calls < code > selectionChanged ( IStructuredSelection ) < /code > when the selection is a structured one . Subclasses may extend this method to react to the change .
559	Returns a constraint representing the specified alternative constraints , with duplicate constraints removed . If a single constraint remains after duplicates are removed , then that constraint is returned , otherwise an instance of < code > ConstraintAlternatives < /code > containing the remaining constraints is returned . The argument passed to this method is neither modified nor retained ; subsequent changes to that argument have no effect on the instance created .
566	Propagate All String Constants -- Propagate all string constants , not just class names . When this option is set to false , Paddle only distinguishes string constants that may be the name of a class loaded dynamically using reflection , and all other string constants are lumped together into a single string constant node . Setting this option to true causes all string constants to be propagated individually .
568	Set the end key of the get request . If it is set , the get request will return the keys from < i > key < /i > to < i > endKey < /i > ( exclusive ) . < p > If end key is '\0 ' , the range is all keys > = key . < p > If the end key is one bit larger than the given key , then it gets all keys with the prefix ( the given key ) . < p > If both key and end key are '\0 ' , it returns all keys .
574	Set the Sounds to be played when a Pull Event happens . You specify which sound plays for which events by calling this method multiple times for each event . < p/ > If you 've already set a sound for a certain event , and add another sound for that event , only the new sound will be played .

720	Provides access to the key of the mapping at the iterator 's position . Note that you must < tt > advance ( ) < /tt > the iterator at least once before invoking this method .
722	Hook for blocking navigation by the Cordova WebView . This applies both to top-level and iframe navigations . This will be called when the WebView 's needs to know whether to navigate to a new page . Return false to block the navigation : if any plugin returns false , Cordova will block the navigation . If all plugins return null , the default policy will be enforced . It at least one plugin returns true , and no plugins return false , then the navigation will proceed .
724	Finds the implementation Class object in the specified order . The specified order is the following : < ol > < li > query the system property using < code > System.getProperty < /code > < li > read < code > META-INF/services/ < i > factoryId < /i > < /code > file < li > use fallback classname < /ol >
733	Merge String Buffer -- Represent all StringBuffers as one object .

748	This method checks if the given JobRow satisfies all the JobRowFilters and returns true if it does . If a JobField in any of the filters is not a part of the JobRow , this method throws an IllegalArgumentException .
753	Helper method to trigger an immediate sync ( `` refresh '' ) . < p > This should only be used when we need to preempt the normal sync schedule . Typically , this means the user has pressed the `` refresh '' button . < p > Note that SYNC_EXTRAS_MANUAL will cause an immediate sync , without any optimization to preserve battery life . If you know new data is available ( perhaps via a GCM notification ) , but the user is not actively waiting for that data , you should omit this flag ; this will give the OS additional freedom in scheduling your sync request .
764	Indicates if the Process needs rebooting for the changes to apply . Only available for changes that do not need propagating to the DAQ ( for these changes , the DAQ makes the reboot decision ) .
766	< code > hashCode < /code > returns a unique code for this vector object based on it 's values . If two vectors are logically equivalent , they will return the same hash code value .

866	Returns a view of the portion of this list between < tt > fromIndex < /tt > , inclusive , and < tt > toIndex < /tt > , exclusive . The returned list is backed by this list , so changes in the returned list are reflected in this list , and vice-versa . While mutative operations are supported , they are probably not very useful for CopyOnWriteArrayLists . < p > The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if the backing list ( i.e. , this list ) is < i > structurally modified < /i > in any way other than via the returned list . ( Structural modifications are those that change the size of the list , or otherwise perturb it in such a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results . )
867	Copy bytes from a < code > File < /code > to an < code > OutputStream < /code > . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > . < /p >

If the stream has not been marked , then attempt to reset it in some way appropriate to the particular stream , for example by repositioning it to its starting point . Not all character-input streams support the reset ( ) operation , and some support reset ( ) without supporting mark ( ) .
924	If the application decides to terminate parsing before the xml document is fully parsed , the application should call this method to free any resource allocated during parsing . For example , close all opened streams .
946	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to the specified < code > File < /code > line by line . The default VM encoding and the specified line ending will be used .
954	By default , the initial load process will chunk large tables and will iterate over the table ( entity ) per chunk ( concurrently ) . This setting allows to control the chunk size to split the table by . By default , set to < code > 100,000 < /code > . Batching can be disabled by setting < code > -1 < /code > .

1098	< code > intersectWherePlanar < /code > determines if the Ray intersects a triangle defined by the specified points and if so it stores the point of intersection in the given loc vector as t , u , v where t is the distance from the origin to the point of intersection and u , v is the intersection point in terms of the triangle plane .
1100	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . < p/ > This should only be used on AdapterView 's such as ListView as it just calls through to overScrollBy ( ) with the scrollRange = 0 . AdapterView 's do not have a scroll range ( i.e . getScrollY ( ) does n't work ) .
1123	Find the within-bin kernel for the bin with lower bound lower and upper bound upper . All bins other than the first contain 10 points exclusive of the lower bound and are centered at ( lower + upper + 1 ) / 2 . The first bin includes its lower bound , 0 , so has different mean and standard deviation .
1145	Implements the same behaviour as the `` touch '' utility on Unix . It creates a new file with size 0 or , if the file exists already , it is opened and closed without modifying it , but updating the file date and time . < p/ > NOTE : As from v1.3 , this method throws an IOException if the last modified date of the file can not be set . Also , as from v1.3 this method creates parent directories if they do not exist .
1168	Returns the number of elements in this applyTransformToDestination ( its cardinality ) . If this applyTransformToDestination contains more than < tt > Integer.MAX_VALUE < /tt > elements , returns < tt > Integer.MAX_VALUE < /tt > .
1176	Check which elements are valid to appear at this point . This method also works if the state is in error , in which case it returns what should have been seen .
1179	Insert Redundant Casts -- . Insert extra casts for the Java bytecode verifier . The verifier may complain if the inlined method uses this and the declared type of the receiver of the call being inlined is different from the type implementing the target method being inlined . Say , for example , that Singer is an interface declaring the sing ( ) method and that the call graph shows that all receiver objects at a particular call site , singer.sing ( ) ( with singer declared as a Singer ) are in fact Bird objects ( Bird being a class that implements Singer ) . The implementation of Bird.sing ( ) may perform operations on this which are only allowed on Birds , rather than Singers . The Insert Redundant Casts option ensures that this can not lead to verification errors , by inserting a cast of bird to the Bird type before inlining the body of Bird.sing ( ) .
1203	Notify that client is disconnected - we must clear waiting request to LoginServer if any to prevent leaks . Also notify LoginServer that this account is no longer on GameServer side .
1213	Determine context has access to the given permission . < p/ > This is a workaround for RuntimeException of Parcel # readException . For more detail , check this issue https : //github.com/hotchemi/PermissionsDispatcher/issues/107

1253	This method lists the entries of the current working directory parsing the reply to a FTP LIST command . The response to the LIST command is parsed through the FTPListParser objects registered on the client . The distribution of ftp4j contains some standard parsers already registered on every FTPClient object created . If they do n't work in your case ( a FTPListParseException is thrown ) , you can build your own parser implementing the FTPListParser interface and add it to the client by calling its addListParser ( ) method . Calling this method blocks the current thread until the operation is completed . The operation could be interrupted by another thread calling abortCurrentDataTransfer ( ) . The list ( ) method will break with a FTPAbortedException .
1254	Remove a PropertyChangeListener for a specific property . If < code > listener < /code > was added more than once to the same event source for the specified property , it will be notified one less time after being removed . If < code > propertyName < /code > is null , no exception is thrown and no action is taken . If < code > listener < /code > is null , or was never added for the specified property , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .
1306	Set the Sounds to be played when a Pull Event happens . You specify which sound plays for which events by calling this method multiple times for each event . < p/ > If you 've already set a sound for a certain event , and add another sound for that event , only the new sound will be played .
1331	Get the distance between this location and another . The value of this method is not cached and uses a costly square-root function , so do not repeatedly call this method to get the location 's magnitude . NaN will be returned if the inner result of the sqrt ( ) function overflows , which will be caused if the distance is too long .
1339	When performing initial load , this flag indicates if the generated query will order to results by the id . By default set to < code > true < /code > as it most times results in better initial load performance .

1772	Will automatically adjust the S component to be less than or equal to half the curve order , if necessary . This is required because for every signature ( r , s ) the signature ( r , -s ( mod N ) ) is a valid signature of the same message . However , we dislike the ability to modify the bits of a Bitcoin transaction after it 's been signed , as that violates various assumed invariants . Thus in future only one of those forms will be considered legal and the other will be banned .
1774	Starts the bulk timer . The BulkTimer maintains a timer for itself ( called SELF ) . This is used to measure the overall time for a bulk timer . When timing data is displayed , the percentage of total time is displayed .

1780	Stops the recording . < p/ > Note that stopping the thread explicitely is not necessary . Once no more data can be read from the TargetDataLine , no more data be read from our AudioInputStream . And if there is no more data from the AudioInputStream , the method 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' ( called in 'run ( ) ' returns . Returning from 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' is followed by returning from 'run ( ) ' , and thus , the thread is terminated automatically . < p/ > It 's not a good idea to call this method just 'stop ( ) ' because stop ( ) is a ( deprecated ) method of the class 'Thread ' . And we do n't want to override this method .
1783	Add an Observable.OnPropertyChangedCallback to ViewModel that will be removed on View destroy < p > Use this method to add Observable.OnPropertyChangedCallback to ViewModel . All callbacks will be removed on View destroy . It helps avoid memory leaks via callbacks .

1881	DOM Level 3 WD - Experimental . Creates an < code > DOMASBuilder < /code > .Do we need the method since we already have < code > DOMImplementationLS.createDOMParser < /code > ?
1897	Wake up any threads waiting on this notifier . In general , because there is no wakeup-waiting flag , this method must be called from a thread that holds a lock that conflicts with the lock that the waiter was holding . If the waiter calls writerWait , then waiterNotify can be called either under a readLock or a writeLock , but if the waiter calls readerWait , then waiterNotify should only be called under a writeLock .
1899	`` true '' - to return photos only from standard albums `` false '' - to return all photos including those in service albums , e.g. , `` My wall photos '' ( default )

If < code > listener < /code > is null , or was never added , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .
1958	A processing instruction . Processing instructions consist of a target name and , optionally , text data . The data is only meaningful to the application . < p/ > Typically , a processing instruction 's data will contain a series of pseudo-attributes . These pseudo-attributes follow the form of element attributes but are < strong > not < /strong > parsed or presented to the application as anything other than text . The application is responsible for parsing the data .
1969	< p > Recursive get the original target object . < p > If integrate more than a plugin , maybe there are conflict in these plugins , because plugin will proxy the object. < br > So , here get the orignal target object
2004	Switches the underlying output stream from a memory based stream to one that is backed by disk . This is the point at which we realise that too much data is being written to keep in memory , so we elect to switch to disk-based storage .

2439	Writes a String to a file creating the file if it does not exist . < p/ > NOTE : As from v1.3 , the parent directories of the file will be created if they do not exist .
2451	Write contents of the annotation to the specified DOM object . If the specified < code > target < /code > object is a DOM in-scope namespace declarations for < code > annotation < /code > element are added as attributes nodes of the serialized < code > annotation < /code > , otherwise the corresponding events for all in-scope namespace declaration are sent via specified document handler .
2465	Insert a badge associated with the specified package and activity names asynchronously . The package and activity names must correspond to an activity that holds an intent filter with action `` android.intent.action.MAIN '' and category `` android.intent.category.LAUNCHER '' in the manifest . Also , it is not allowed to publish badges on behalf of another client , so the package and activity names must belong to the process from which the insert is made . To be able to insert badges , the app must have the PROVIDER_INSERT_BADGE permission in the manifest file . In case these conditions are not fulfilled , or any content values are missing , there will be an unhandled exception on the background thread .
2477	Nested report can be set , if the ProcessChange event gets triggered by a nested child action . Example : Remove Sub-Equipment triggers also a Remove Alive tag on the process .
2480	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a String using the specified character encoding . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > . < /p >
2483	Returns the number of bytes currently being used to store the values in this cache . This may be greater than the max size if a background deletion is pending .
2487	Returns a hashcode value for the specified symbol . The value returned by this method must be identical to the value returned by the < code > hash ( char [ ] , int , int ) < /code > method when called with the character array that comprises the symbol string .
2501	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a character array using the default character encoding of the platform . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
2502	For a double precision value x , this method returns +1.0 if x > = 0 and -1.0 if x < 0 . Returns < code > NaN < /code > if < code > x < /code > is < code > NaN < /code > .
2503	Return < tt > true < /tt > if the integer argument includes the < tt > RETURN_PREV_ON_UPDATE < /tt > modifier , < tt > false < /tt > otherwise .
2513	By default , the initial load process will chunk large tables and will iterate over the table ( entity ) per chunk ( concurrently ) . This setting allows to control the chunk size to split the table by . By default , set to < code > 100,000 < /code > . Batching can be disabled by setting < code > -1 < /code > .
2516	Introduced in DOM Level 2 . < p > Creates an element of the given qualified name and namespace URI . If the given namespaceURI is null or an empty string and the qualifiedName has a prefix that is `` xml '' , the created element is bound to the predefined namespace `` http : //www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace '' [ Namespaces ] .
2527	Move to the next record satisfying the predicate . The method repeatedly calls next on the underlying scan until a suitable record is found , or the underlying scan contains no more records .
2541	Applies these insets to the given bounds rectangle by subtracting them . For example , for a view that has margins , you can subtract the margins to the bounds to find out the real bounds prior to the margins being applied .
2543	Get the contents of a < code > byte [ ] < /code > as a String using the specified character encoding . < p/ > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > .
2553	Add a font mapping rule to this FontAction . VisualItems that match the provided expression will be assigned the given font value ( assuming they do not match an earlier rule ) . The provided expression String will be parsed to generate the needed rule Predicate .
2560	Set the byte count back to 0 . < p > NOTE : This method is an alternative for < code > resetCount ( ) < /code > and was added because that method returns an integer which will result in incorrect count for files over 2GB .
2568	A single preview frame will be returned to the handler supplied . The data will arrive as byte [ ] in the message.obj field , with width and height encoded as message.arg1 and message.arg2 , respectively .
2598	Tries to guess the true amount of lines in a code file ignoring those that are blank or comments fairly crude however without resorting to parsing which is slow its good enough for our purposes
2609	if the given key ( s ) is present in the map , create a long switch ( -- switch ) with the given transformation to create the switch name from the key
2623	Constructs the observable chain that stores the JobRow in the ApiJobStore , and then emits the JobRow upon successful storage of the ApiJobStore . < p > If an error occurs while attempting to store the JobRow , the error is logged and the JobRow is still emitted .
2632	Returns an operator that delays onNext , onComplete and onError emissions until a True value received from a given observable . When the given observable emits False , the operator starts delaying emissions again .
2634	With Array References -- . With this option enabled , array references can be considered as common subexpressions ; however , we are more conservative when writing into an array , because array objects may be aliased . We also assume that the application is single-threaded or that the array references occur in a synchronized block . That is , we assume that an array element may not be changed by other threads between two array references .
2636	Char to string . Convert an integer character number to a standard Java string ( that is , encode the character as UTF-16 text ) . This isolates one of the code differences between Java 1.4 and Java 5.0 inside a single common method .
2640	Worklist type -- Worklist type . Specifies the worklist used for selecting the next propagation pointer . All possible options are : PQ , FIFO . They stand for the priority queue ( sorted by the last fire time and topology order ) and FIFO queue .
2649	With this option enabled , the map tracks when you pan to another `` copy '' of the world and seamlessly jumps to the original one so that all overlays like markers and vector layers are still visible . default false
2656	Add the given resources to the project . < p > The sematics follow that of SVN in the sense that any folders and files are created remotely on the next commit . < /p >
2672	Overrides < code > ObjectInputStream.resolveClass < /code > to change an occurence of class < code > net.jini.io.MarshalledObject < /code > to class < code > java.rmi.MarshalledObject < /code > .
2675	DOM Level 3 WD - Experimental . < p/ > Replaces the content of the document with the result of parsing the given URI . Invoking this method will either block the caller or return to the caller immediately depending on the value of the async attribute . Once the document is fully loaded a `` load '' event ( as defined in [ < a href='http : //www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20030331 ' > DOM Level 3 Events < /a > ] , except that the < code > Event.targetNode < /code > will be the document , not an element ) will be dispatched on the document . If an error occurs , an implementation dependent `` error '' event will be dispatched on the document . If this method is called on a document that is currently loading , the current load is interrupted and the new URI load is initiated . < br > When invoking this method the parameters used in the < code > DOMParser < /code > interface are assumed to have their default values with the exception that the parameters < code > '' entities '' < /code > , < code > '' normalize-characters '' < /code > , < code > '' check-character-normalization '' < /code > are set to < code > '' false '' < /code > . < br > The result of a call to this method is the same the result of a call to < code > DOMParser.parseWithContext < /code > with an input stream referencing the URI that was passed to this call , the document as the context node , and the action < code > ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN < /code > .
2676	Specifies the maximum number of resources the pool may contain , regardless of the category it is associated with . Note that the pool < b > may evict a resource before this limit is exceeded < /b > . As the pool size grows close to the maximum , the pool evicts entries that are less likely to be used again .
2694	Called by an independent thread in order to look for an ElasticSearch cluster and connect to it . This creates a transport client that is able to communicate with the nodes .
2712	Insert a major boundary after token number < code > i < /code > in < code > tokens < /code > . < p/ > Also inserts a phrase tag at the appropriate position .
2726	Converts the < code > double < /code > argument to a < code > long < /code > using the < code > doubleToLongBits < /code > method in class < code > Double < /code > , and then writes that < code > long < /code > value to the bytes message stream as an 8-byte quantity , high byte first .
2734	Serializes the provided record into a byte [ ] . Uses the DataTypes 's serialization methods . A serialized record is represented as the concatenation of each serialized DataType . This method assumes that the input record corresponds to this schema .
2739	Sets the amount of padding in the top left corner of a map container that should n't be accounted for when setting the view to fit bounds . Useful if you have some control overlays on the map like a sidebar and you do n't want them to obscure objects you 're zooming to . < /br > default [ 0 , 0 ]
2740	Refresh lucene index Query the lucene indexes on key column to see if there are any existing indexes . If yes , then we need to update the indexes . Update is done by first deleting the existing documents and then adding new ones . If not , then just add the documents to indexes .
2743	Force Garbage Collections -- Force garbage collection for measuring memory usage . When this option is set to true , calls to System.gc ( ) will be made at various points to allow memory usage to be measured .
2772	Validate scheme . If schemes [ ] was initialized to a non null , then only those schemes are allowed . Otherwise the default schemes are `` http '' , `` https '' , `` ftp '' . Matching is case-blind .
2782	Interpolates this transform linearly , by alpha , given the change in position ( & Delta ; p ) and the change in angle ( & Delta ; a ) .
2792	Insert a node in a KD-tree . Uses algorithm translated from 352.ins.c of < PRE > & *064 ; Book { GonnetBaezaYates1991 , author = { G.H . Gonnet and R. Baeza-Yates } , title = { Handbook of Algorithms and Data Structures } , publisher = { Addison-Wesley } , year = { 1991 } } < /PRE >
2801	Encoding methodology used -- Encoding methodology . This switch specifies the encoding methodology used in the analysis . All possible options are : Geom , HeapIns , PtIns . The efficiency order is ( from slow to fast ) Geom - HeapIns - PtIns , but the precision order is the reverse .
2808	Format method for the d conversion character and long argument . < p/ > For d format , the flag character '- ' , means that the output should be left justified within the field . The default is to pad with blanks on the left . A '+ ' character means that the conversion will always begin with a sign ( + or - ) . The blank flag character means that a non-negative input will be preceded with a blank . If both a '+ ' and a ' ' are specified , the blank flag is ignored . The ' 0 ' flag character implies that padding to the field width will be done with zeros instead of blanks . < p/ > The field width is treated as the minimum number of characters to be printed . The default is to add no padding . Padding is with blanks by default . < p/ > The precision , if set , is the minimum number of digits to appear . Padding is with leading 0s .
2814	Utility to make a composite parameter from the given prefix and suffix . The prefix should be a regular paramter name such as meetingDate . The suffix is the composite field , such as the hour of the meeting . The result would be meetingDate_ $ { COMPOSITE_DELIMITER } _hour .
2823	Creates a basic Experiment with the required default values and the optional value rule . ( No ID ! ) The values are a name , the default application , a start and end time , the sampling percentage ( 100 % ) and a a simple rule .
2871	Put or replace a double value . If the index is greater than the length of the JSONArray , then null elements will be added as necessary to pad it out .
2894	Removes observations represented by the elements in < code > data < /code > . < p > If the array is larger than the current n , only the first n elements are processed . This method permits the use of SimpleRegression instances in streaming mode where the regression is applied to a sliding `` window '' of observations , however the caller is responsible for maintaining the set of observations in the window. < /p > < p > To remove all data , use < code > clear ( ) < /code > . < /p >
2913	Registers a message formatter for the specified domain . < p/ > < strong > Note : < /strong > Registering a message formatter for a domain when there is already a formatter registered will cause the previous formatter to be lost . This method replaces any previously registered message formatter for the specified domain .
2914	Add a configuration resource . The properties of this resource will override properties of previously added resources , unless they were marked < a href= '' # Final '' > final < /a > .
2917	Optical Character Recognition ( OCR ) detects text in an image and extracts the recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream . < p > Upon success , the OCR results will be returned . < p > Upon failure , the error code together with an error message will be returned . The error code can be one of InvalidImageUrl , InvalidImageFormat , InvalidImageSize , NotSupportedImage , NotSupportedLanguage , or InternalServerError .
2941	On Fly Call Graph -- Build call graph as receiver types become known . When this option is set to true , the call graph is computed on-the-fly as points-to information is computed . Otherwise , an initial CHA approximation to the call graph is used .
2942	Whether the application is in the early stage since the browser process start . The `` application start '' ends right after the last histogram related to browser startup is recorded . Currently , the very first navigation commit in the lifetime of the process ends the `` application start '' . Must only be called on the UI thread .
2947	Returns the object in the cache . If this object was loaded before , then the original object is returned ( the cached version is more recent ) . If this is the first time this object is loaded , then the loadedObject is added to the cache .
2954	< p > Creates an operation that will prepare SDK so the components can be installed. < /p > < p > Supported scenarios : < /p > < ol > < li > Install wizard leaves SDK repository to merge - merge will happen whether destination exists or not. < /li > < li > Valid SDK at destination - do nothing , the wizard will update components later < /li > < li > No handoff , no valid SDK at destination - SDK `` seed '' will be downloaded and unpacked < /li > < /ol >
2978	% WORLDNAME0 % region restricts access . You can not reenter the region for % 1 minute ( s ) if all your group members left the region or if you left the current group .
2981	< code > divideLocal < /code > divides this vector by a scalar internally , and returns a handle to this vector for easy chaining of calls . Dividing by zero will result in an exception .
2983	< code > mult < /code > multiplies this matrix by a given < code > Vector3f < /code > object . The result vector is returned . If the given vector is null , null will be returned .
3001	Set the Sounds to be played when a Pull Event happens . You specify which sound plays for which events by calling this method multiple times for each event . < p/ > If you 've already set a sound for a certain event , and add another sound for that event , only the new sound will be played .
3020	List of media objects attached to the comment , in the following format : `` type '' '' owner_id '' _ '' media_id '' `` '' type '' '' - Type of media object : `` photo '' - photo `` video '' - video `` audio '' - audio `` doc '' - document `` '' owner_id '' '' - ID of the media owner . `` `` media_id '' '' - Media ID . < p > Example : photo100172_166443618 , photo66748_265827614 < p > Required if `` message '' is not set .
3033	Convert a well-formed ( but not necessarily valid ) XML string into a JSONObject . Some information may be lost in this transformation because JSON is a signalData format and XML is a document format . XML uses elements , attributes , and content text , while JSON uses unordered collections of name/value pairs and arrays of values . JSON does not does not like to distinguish between elements and attributes . Sequences of similar elements are represented as JSONArrays . Content text may be placed in a `` content '' member . Comments , prologs , DTDs , and < code > & lt ; [ [ ] ] > < /code > are ignored .
3052	Reports an ignored relative path . ( We use a path string rather than a file since we want to include a trailing file separator on directories ; these relative paths are not interpreted in any way other than to display in the report . )
3071	Returns the < a href= '' http : //mathworld.wolfram.com/Sign.html '' > sign < /a > for double precision < code > x < /code > . < p > For a double value < code > x < /code > , this method returns < code > +1.0 < /code > if < code > x > 0 < /code > , < code > 0.0 < /code > if < code > x = 0.0 < /code > , and < code > -1.0 < /code > if < code > x < 0 < /code > . Returns < code > NaN < /code > if < code > x < /code > is < code > NaN < /code > . < /p >
3092	Adds a dynamic parameter value . < ul > < li > All template parameters within the parameter value and name are resolved. < /li > < li > The parameter value replaces the previous parameter value. < /li > < li > A file defined by the parameter will not be deleted on exit. < /li > < /ul >
3095	When an update to a Tag is received from the cache , evaluates the associated Alarms and notifies the ( alarm + tag ) listeners . < p > Notice that received Tag is a clone , but since the cache notification is synchronous a lock is already held on this tag , which can therefore not be modified during this call .
3098	Reads the next byte of data from this input stream . The value byte is returned as an < code > int < /code > in the range < code > 0 < /code > to < code > 255 < /code > . If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached , the value < code > -1 < /code > is returned . < p > This < code > read < /code > method can not block .
3106	For audio data , append more audio data to the one currently present . If no audio data is set yet , this call is equivalent to setAudio ( ) .
3107	Adds a custom change operation to be executed . Note that when using a replicated topology ( e.g . backup space , gateway , mirror ) the change operation itself is replicated ( and *NOT* the modified entry ) . Hence , it is imperative that this method will always cause the exact same affect on the entry assuming the same entry was provided , for example it should not rely on variables that may change between executions , such as system time , random , machine name etc . If the operation is not structured that way , the state can be inconsistent in the different locations after being replicated ( `` With great power comes great responsibility '' ) . In a secured space , unlike built-in change operations , the security privilege required for custom change operation is EXECUTE instead of WRITE .
3114	Copy bytes from an < code > InputStream < /code > to an < code > OutputStream < /code > . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > . < p/ > Large streams ( over 2GB ) will return a bytes copied value of < code > -1 < /code > after the copy has completed since the correct number of bytes can not be returned as an int . For large streams use the < code > copyLarge ( InputStream , OutputStream ) < /code > method .
3126	Replacement for < code > Class.forName ( ) < /code > that also returns Class instances for primitives ( like `` int '' ) and array class names ( like `` String [ ] '' ) . < p > Always uses the default class loader : that is , preferably the thread context class loader , or the ClassLoader that loaded the ClassUtils class as fallback .
3131	Goes through the log , rolling back all uncompleted transactions . Flushes all modified blocks . Finally , writes a quiescent checkpoint record to the log and flush it . This method should be called only during system startup , before user transactions begin .
3145	Returns all the text at the given URL . If the file can not be read ( non-existent , etc . ) , then and only then the method returns < code > null < /code > .
3155	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to the specified < code > File < /code > line by line . The default VM encoding and the specified line ending will be used .
3162	Profiling -- Insert instructions to count safe pointer accesses . Insert profiling instructions that at runtime count the number of eliminated safe null pointer checks . The inserted profiling code assumes the existence of a MultiCounter class implementing the methods invoked . For details , see the NullPointerChecker source code .
3165	Manually notify the manager that an editor is about to be shown ; typically done right after switching to a file to show an update as soon as possible . This is used when we know the editor is about to be shown ( because we 've requested it ) . We do n't have a way to add a listener which is called after the requested file has been opened , so instead we simply anticipate the change by calling this method first ; the subsequent file open will then become a no-op since the file does n't change .
3173	< p > Generates a stream that is computed from a provided stream following two steps. < /p > < p > The first steps maps this stream to an < code > IntStream < /code > that is then rolled following the same principle as the < code > roll ( ) < /code > method . This steps builds a < code > Stream & lt ; IntStream & gt ; < /code > . < /p > < p > Then the < code > average ( ) < /code > method is called on each < code > IntStream < /code > using a mapper , and a < code > DoubleStream < /code > of averages is returned. < /p > < p > The resulting stream has the same number of elements as the provided stream , minus the size of the window width , to preserve consistency of each collection . < /p > < p > A < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown if the provided stream or the mapper is null. < /p >
3174	Returns the tooltip instance to use for this Display . By default , uses the normal Swing tooltips , returning the result of this same method invoked on the JComponent super-class . If a custom tooltip has been set , that is returned instead .
3181	Reads value field of an entry under lock . Called if value field ever appears to be null . This is possible only if a compiler happens to reorder a IHashEntry initialization with its table assignment , which is legal under memory model but is not known to ever occur .
3183	Inserts a slot to the current BTreePage . Since this whole action must be done atomically in a buffer , it will lock the flushing mechanism of the buffer to ensure no one can flush during the operation .
3192	-1 is used to represent bad transitions in the transition table entry for each state . So each entry is initialized to an all -1 array . This method creates a new entry and initializes it .
3201	Sources to obtain news from , separated by commas . < p > User IDs can be specified in formats `` user_id '' or `` u '' user_id '' '' where `` '' user_id '' '' is the user 's friend ID . < p > Community IDs can be specified in formats `` - '' group_id '' '' or `` g '' group_id '' '' where `` group_id '' is the community ID . < p > If the parameter is not set , all of the user 's friends and communities are returned , except for banned sources , which can be obtained with the newsfeed.getBanned method .
3204	Compute the dot-product of the instance and another vector . < p > The implementation uses specific multiplication and addition algorithms to preserve accuracy and reduce cancellation effects . It should be very accurate even for nearly orthogonal vectors . < /p >
3233	Decode an image using the state set up by calling setHints ( ) previously . Continuous scan clients will get a < b > large < /b > speed increase by using this instead of decode ( ) .
3236	Make newChild occupy the location that oldChild used to have . Note that newChild will first be removed from its previous parent , if any . Equivalent to inserting newChild before oldChild , then removing oldChild .
3240	Publishes the payload to a given topic . This is a blocking call so the calling thread is blocked until the publish operation succeeded or failed . < p > Note : Blocking API call without specifying a timeout , in very rare cases , can block the calling thread indefinitely , if the server response is not received or lost . Use the alternative APIs with timeout for applications that expect responses within fixed duration . < /p >
3252	Parses the string argument as a boolean . The < code > boolean < /code > returned represents the value < code > true < /code > if the string argument is not < code > null < /code > , is not a sys-property , and is equal , ignoring case , to the string < code > '' true '' < /code > .
3260	Add a size mapping rule to this SizeAction . VisualItems that match the provided expression will be assigned the given size value ( assuming they do not match an earlier rule ) . The provided expression String will be parsed to generate the needed rule Predicate .
3263	Add an Observable.OnPropertyChangedCallback to ViewModel that will be removed on View destroy < p > Use this method to add Observable.OnPropertyChangedCallback to ViewModel . All callbacks will be removed on View destroy . It helps avoid memory leaks via callbacks .
3265	Return an iterator over a range of rwos in this table , determined by a bounded range for a given data field . A new index over the data field will be created if it does n't already exist .
3274	Put or replace an int value . If the index is greater than the length of the JSONArray , then null elements will be added as necessary to pad it out .
3276	Dump HTML -- Dump pointer assignment graph to HTML for debugging . When this option is set to true , a browseable HTML representation of the pointer assignment graph is output to a file called pag.jar after the analysis completes . Note that this representation is typically very large .
3347	Get the contents of a < code > Reader < /code > as a character array . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > .
3352	Get the contents of a < code > Reader < /code > as a character array . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > .
3358	Returns true if ( current * radix ) + digit is a number too large to be represented by an unsigned long . This is useful for detecting overflow while parsing a string representation of a number . Does not verify whether supplied radix is valid , passing an invalid radix will give undefined results or an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException .
3359	Returns a functions of [ element graph edges max ] , [ number of neighbours ] , where [ element graph edges max ] refers to the maximum weight of the edges including [ sNode ] , and [ number of neightbours ] is its number of neighbours in the graph .
3361	Get an optional double associated with a key , or the defaultValue if there is no such key or if its value is not a number . If the value is a string , an attempt will be made to evaluate it as a number .
3373	Parse an XML Schema document from a location identified by a URI reference . If the URI contains a fragment identifier , the behavior is not defined by this specification .
3376	Get the exponent of the greatest power of 10000 that is less than or equal to the absolute value of this . I.E . if this is 10 < sup > 6 < /sup > then log10K would return 1 .
3377	Ignore changes that would trigger a RTEditTextListener.onTextChanged ( ) method call . We need this during the actual undo/redo operation ( or an undo would create a change event itself ) .
3384	This method checks whether the equipment 's time is too far in the future or not . For doing that , the equipment 's time is compared to the system 's time
3390	User `` ip address '' . Note that user may access using the `` ipv6 '' address , in this case it is required to transmit the `` ipv6 '' address . If not transmitted , the address will not be checked .
3394	/ Add a listener to be handed all certificate chains . Use this solely for diagnostic purposes ( e.g. , to understand what root CA to add to a network security configuration ) . Do not use this in production code .
3401	Resets variables maintaining the sum to zero . This method may be a useful alternative to creating a new adder , but is only effective if there are no concurrent updates . Because this method is intrinsically racy , it should only be used when it is known that no threads are concurrently updating .
3440	Class Method Var -- In dump , label variables by class and method . When this option is set to true , the representation dumped by the Dump PAG option represents nodes by numbering each class , method , and variable within the method separately , rather than assigning a single integer to each node . This option has no effect unless Dump PAG is true . Setting Class Method Var to true has the effect of setting Topological Sort to false .
3450	The open interface for other classes in CRUD package to delete . Using modelClass to decide which table to delete from , and id to decide a specific row . This method can action cascade delete . When the record is deleted from database , all the referenced data such as foreign key value will be removed too .
3457	A single preview frame will be returned to the handler supplied . The data will arrive as byte [ ] in the message.obj field , with width and height encoded as message.arg1 and message.arg2 , respectively .
3471	Get the contents of a < code > Reader < /code > as a < code > byte [ ] < /code > using the default character encoding of the platform . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > .
3479	Terminates all threads , ending all discovery processing being performed by the current instance of this class . < p > After this method has been invoked , no new lookup services will be discovered , and the effect of any new operations performed on the current instance of this class are undefined .
3483	With Class Field -- . This option makes the analysis work on the class level . The algorithm analyzes final or private class fields first . It can recognize the fields that hold array objects of constant length . In an application using lots of array fields , this option can improve the analysis results dramatically .
3487	Whether to use the foreground color . When using images as the source asset for our icons , you should n't apply the foreground color , which would paint over it and obscure the image .
3514	Get the optional int value associated with an index . Zero is returned if there is no value for the index , or if the value is not a number and can not be converted to a number .
3515	Put or replace a long value . If the index is greater than the length of the JSONArray , then null elements will be added as necessary to pad it out .

4293	NOTE : the semantic of forName0 follows forName method . Returns the Class object associated with the class or interface with the given string name , using the given class loader . Given the fully qualified name for a class or interface ( in the same format returned by getName ) this method attempts to locate , load , and link the class or interface . The specified class loader is used to load the class or interface . If the parameter loader is null , the class is loaded through the bootstrap class loader . The class is initialized only if the initialize parameter is true and if it has not been initialized earlier . If name denotes a primitive type or void , an attempt will be made to locate a user-defined class in the unnamed package whose name is name . Therefore , this method can not be used to obtain any of the Class objects representing primitive types or void . If name denotes an array class , the component type of the array class is loaded but not initialized . For example , in an instance method the expression : Class.forName ( `` Foo '' ) is equivalent to : Class.forName ( `` Foo '' , true , this.getClass ( ) .getClassLoader ( ) ) private static native java.lang.Class forName0 ( java.lang.String , boolean , java.lang.ClassLoader ) throws java.lang.ClassNotFoundException ;
4298	Closes this audio player < p/ > [ [ [ WORKAROUND TODO The javax.sound.sampled drain is almost working properly .

We wait for a few hundred milliseconds while the data is really drained out of the system ] ] ]
4301	Set the Sounds to be played when a Pull Event happens . You specify which sound plays for which events by calling this method multiple times for each event . < p/ > If you 've already set a sound for a certain event , and add another sound for that event , only the new sound will be played .
4304	Converts the provided byte array to a String using the UTF-8 encoding . If < code > replace < /code > is true , then malformed input is replaced with the substitution character , which is U+FFFD . Otherwise the method throws a MalformedInputException .
4320	Checks the current thread against the expected primary thread for the server . < p > < b > Note : < /b > this method should not be used to indicate the current synchronized state of the runtime . A current thread matching the main thread indicates that it is synchronized , but a mismatch < b > does not preclude < /b > the same assumption .
4332	Closing a < tt > ByteArrayOutputStream < /tt > has no effect . The methods in this class can be called after the stream has been closed without generating an < tt > IOException < /tt > .
4342	Provides access to the value of the mapping at the iterator 's position . Note that you must < tt > advance ( ) < /tt > the iterator at least once before invoking this method .
4344	SCIPIO : Returns true if value is Boolean.TRUE or `` true '' , or false if value is Boolean.FALSE or `` false '' , or defaultValue if anything else . < p > NOTE : case-sensitive .
4357	Open the atomic file for reading . If there previously was an incomplete write , this will roll back to the last good data before opening for read . You should call close ( ) on the FileInputStream when you are done reading from it . < p > Note that if another thread is currently performing a write , this will incorrectly consider it to be in the state of a bad write and roll back , causing the new data currently being written to be dropped . You must do your own threading protection for access to AtomicFile .
4358	Takes one or more lists of intervals , and combines them into a single , sorted list with the minimum number of intervals needed to capture exactly the same instants as the original intervals . < p > If any subintervals of the input collection abut or overlap they will be replaced with a single , combined interval . < p > Examples : < ul > < li > [ '2014/2017 ' , '2015/2020 ' ] will combine into [ '2014/2020 ' ] < li > [ '2015/2016 ' , '2016/2017 ' ] will combine into [ '2015/2017 ] < li > [ '2015/2016 ' , '2013/2014 ' ] will sort into [ '2013/2014 ' , '2015/2016 ' ] < li > [ '2015/2015 ' , '2015/2016 ' , '2012/2013 ' ] will sort and combine to [ '2012/2013 ' , '2015/2016 ' ] < /ul >
4366	Returns a property which indicates if any of the components in this panel are invalid . This is a useful property for UIs to listen to , as they can bind various components ( such as a next button ) as appropriate , disabling functionality until all errors are resolved .
4370	check member name according to its usual format : `` spaceName_contaner : spaceName '' if name is not suitable to this format ( indicates that we have a transformation bug ) , then ClusterConfigurationException thrown
4371	Fetch the buffer which holds a read-only view of the LMDI allocated memory . Any use of this buffer must comply with the standard LMDB C `` mdb_get '' contract ( ie do not modify , do not attempt to release the memory , do not use once the transaction or cursor closes , do not use after a write etc ) .
4380	Returns < code > true < /code > if there is an existing transaction held by this bean , < code > false < /code > if no transaction is in progress .
4382	addMutualEdge adds bi-direct edges between two nodes . for example , i = j + 1 ; generates two directed edges . one from j to i with weight 1 , another from i to j with weight -1
4408	Rounds a number , keeping at least 3 significant digits . < p > < ul > < li > If value is > = 10 or < = -10 it will have 1 decimal. < /li > < li > If value is between -10 and 10 it will have three significant digits. < /li > < /ul >
4412	Judge should assign id value to model 's id field . The principle is that if id name is not null , id type is not null and id is greater than 0 , then should assign id value to it .
4420	Force initialization of the static members . As of Java 5 , referencing a class does n't force it to initialize . Since this class requires that the classes be initialized to declare their comparators , we force that initialization to happen .
4428	Flushes all the data up to this point , adds the end of stream marker and marks the stream as read-only in the metadata . No appends to the stream will be allowed after this point
4469	Convenience method used to remove the LocatorReg - corresponding to the given LookupLocator - from the set of LocatorReg objects that correspond to lookup services that have already been discovered .

4681	In a module imported from Maven dependencies are transitive , so we do n't need to traverse all dependency tree and compute all jars referred by library modules . Moreover it would be incorrect , because Maven has dependency resolving algorithm based on versioning
4692	Performs the default outgoing BPMN 2.0 behavior , which is having parallel paths of executions for the outgoing sequence flow . More precisely : every sequence flow that has a condition which evaluates to true ( or which does n't have a condition ) , is selected for continuation of the process instance . If multiple sequencer flow are selected , multiple , parallel paths of executions are created .

5465	Prevent method name collisions . < p > A static method that takes an instance of this class as the first argument might clash with a rewritten instance method , and this rewrites all methods like that . This is an over-approximation of the necessary renames , but it has the advantage of neither adding additional state nor requiring lookups .
5467	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to an < code > OutputStream < /code > line by line , using the specified character encoding and the specified line ending . < p/ > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > .
5470	Finalize a log segment . If the journal manager is currently writing to a ledger , ensure that this is the ledger of the log segment being finalized . < p/ > Otherwise this is the recovery case . In the recovery case , ensure that the firstTxId of the ledger matches firstTxId for the segment we are trying to finalize .
5471	Do a sanity check to see if we have templates that look compatible , otherwise we get really strange problems . The existence of a gradle wrapper in the templates directory is a good sign .
5488	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a character array using the specified character encoding . < p/ > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .

The largest value of < code > n < /code > for which < code > n ! < /code > < Long.MAX_VALUE < /code > is 20 . If the computed value exceeds < code > Long.MAX_VALUE < /code > an < code > ArithMeticException < /code > is thrown. < /li > < /ul > < /p >
5701	Appends a new member to the end of this object , with the specified name and the JSON representation of the specified < code > long < /code > value . < p > This method < strong > does not prevent duplicate names < /strong > . Calling this method with a name that already exists in the object will append another member with the same name . In order to replace existing members , use the method < code > set ( name , value ) < /code > instead . However , < strong > < em > add < /em > is much faster than < em > set < /em > < /strong > ( because it does not need to search for existing members ) . Therefore < em > add < /em > should be preferred when constructing new objects . < /p >
5703	Get the optional int value associated with an index . Zero is returned if there is no value for the index , or if the value is not a number and can not be converted to a number .
5713	Get the distance between this vector and another .

5820	Read a single character . This method will block until a character is available , an I/O error occurs , or the end of the stream is reached . < p/ > < p > Subclasses that intend to support efficient single-character input should override this method .
5882	Deletes the content of a thing shadow . This is a blocking call , so the calling thread will be blocked until the operation succeeded or failed . < p > Note : Blocking API call without specifying a timeout , in very rare cases , can block the calling thread indefinitely , if the server response is not received or lost . Use the alternative APIs with timeout for applications that expect responses within fixed duration . < /p >

Returns < code > Double.NaN < /code > if the designated subarray is empty . < p > Returns 0 for a single-value ( i.e . length = 1 ) sample . < p > The formula used assumes that the supplied mean value is the arithmetic mean of the sample data , not a known population parameter . This method is supplied only to save computation when the mean has already been computed . < p > Does not change the internal state of the statistic .
5937	Check if an object is an instance of a given class , or , if the class is a primitive type , if the Object is an instance of the wrapper class for that primitive ( e.g. , as Integer is a wrapper for int ) .
5939	Creates new Application defined by JMX connection and adds it to the Applications tree . The application wo n't be restored on another VisualVM sessions .

The returned array will be half the length of the passed String or array , as it takes two characters to represent any given byte . An exception is thrown if the passed char array has an odd number of elements .
6040	Use the age of the slabId as a heuristic to determine when we should ignore the lack of the `` open slab marker '' . < p > When a slab is first created , the 'manifest ' row is written with `` open=true '' but no columns are written to the 'slab ' column family . In that initial state , scanning the slab and finding no `` open slab '' marker does *not mean we 've found a stale slab that can be closed or deleted . We could fix this by writing the `` open slab '' marker before writing the manifest ( not in the same batch mutation ) . But since the marker would only live for 20 minutes without a followup write , simply checking the slabId age has exactly the same effect with fewer writes .
6075	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a list of Strings , one entry per line , using the specified character encoding . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .

First , each < code > net.jini.core.transaction.server.TransactionParticipant < /code > in the set of participants joined in the < code > net.jini.core.transaction.server.Transaction < /code > is instructed to vote and the votes are tallied . This is the first phase ( prepare phase ) . Depending on the outcome of the votes , the transaction is considered committed or aborted . Once commit/abort status is known , the participants are notified with a message to either roll-forward ( commit case ) or roll-back ( abort case ) . This is the roll-phase . Since there may be a one-to-many relationship between a transaction and its participants , < code > com.sun.jini.thread.TaskManager < /code > s are used as a generic mechanism to provide the threads needed to interact with the participants .
6176	Returns whether the null hypothesis can be rejected with the given confidence level . < p > < strong > Preconditions < /strong > : < ul > < li > Number of trials must be & ge ; 0. < /li > < li > Number of successes must be & ge ; 0. < /li > < li > Number of successes must be & le ; number of trials. < /li > < li > Probability must be & ge ; 0 and & le ; 1. < /li > < /ul >

6230	Stops the recording . < p/ > Note that stopping the thread explicitely is not necessary . Once no more data can be read from the TargetDataLine , no more data be read from our AudioInputStream . And if there is no more data from the AudioInputStream , the method 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' ( called in 'run ( ) ' returns . Returning from 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' is followed by returning from 'run ( ) ' , and thus , the thread is terminated automatically . < p/ > It 's not a good idea to call this method just 'stop ( ) ' because stop ( ) is a ( deprecated ) method of the class 'Thread ' . And we do n't want to override this method .
6231	Returns true if the specified < code > String < /code > matches any IANA-defined infrastructure top-level domain . Leading dots are ignored if present . The search is case-insensitive .
6232	Build naive dependence graph -- . When set to true , the dependence graph is built with a node for each statement , without merging the nodes for equivalent statements . This makes it possible to measure the effect of merging nodes for equivalent statements on the size of the dependence graph .
6239	This version operates on predicates that treat the given IntPredicate as operating on a packed local time This is much more efficient that using a LocalTimePredicate , but requires that the developer understand the semantics of packedLocalTimes
6247	Close the stream . Once a stream has been closed , further read ( ) , ready ( ) , mark ( ) , or reset ( ) invocations will throw an IOException . Closing a previously-closed stream , however , has no effect .
6269	Simplify Offline -- Collapse single-entry subgraphs of the PAG . When this option is set to true , variable ( Green ) nodes which form single-entry subgraphs ( so they must have the same points-to set ) are merged before propagation begins .

6452	Schedules an Activity to start immediately after another Activity . The second Activity will be scheduled to start immediately after the first one finishes , overwriting any previously set startTime . If the first Activity is cancelled , the second one will not run . This functionality is provided by using an ActivityListener to monitor the first Activity . The listener will persist across mulitple runs , meaning the second Activity will always be evoked upon a successful finish of the first . This method does not otherwise effect the scheduling of the first Activity .

6584	Convert a well-formed ( but not necessarily valid ) XML string into a JSONObject . Some information may be lost in this transformation because JSON is a data format and XML is a document format . XML uses elements , attributes , and content text , while JSON uses unordered collections of name/value pairs and arrays of values . JSON does not does not like to distinguish between elements and attributes . Sequences of similar elements are represented as JSONArrays . Content text may be placed in a `` content '' member . Comments , prologs , DTDs , and < code > & lt ; [ [ ] ] > < /code > are ignored .
6587	If a request comes in with no authentication information at all ( such as will no headers ) then an ID can be associated with these requests to provide controlled access to anonymous requests . If the anonymous ID is null ( which is the default ) then any request that requires authentication will be forbidden .

Called for every such exception in every concurrent listener . < p > The default implementation logs the exception at error level if not recovered yet , and at debug level if already recovered . Can be overridden in subclasses .
6637	With Field References -- . The analysis treats field references ( static and instance ) as common subexpressions ; however , we are more conservative when writing to a field , because the base of the field reference may be aliased . We also assume that the application is single-threaded or that the field references occur in a synchronized block . That is , we assume that a field may not be changed by other threads between two field references .
6648	Computes the correlation matrix for the columns of the input rectangular array . The columns of the array represent values of variables to be correlated .

Pairwise correlations are set to NaN if one of the correlates has zero variance .
6652	Tests if the interior of this < code > Polyline2D < /code > entirely contains the specified set of rectangular coordinates . This method is required to implement the Shape interface , but in the case of Line2D objects it always returns false since a line contains no area .
6658	Enables the use of codebase annotation strings written by the corresponding < code > MarshalOutputStream < /code > . < p > If this method has not been invoked on this stream , then the < code > resolveClass < /code > and < code > resolveProxyClass < /code > methods ignore the class annotation strings and just use a < code > null < /code > codebase value when loading classes . After this method has been invoked , then the < code > resolveClass < /code > and < code > resolveProxyClass < /code > methods use the class annotation strings as codebase values .

6941	Returns true if all characters are numbers ; first character is allowed to be + or - as well . Does not accept floating point , exponential notation , etc .
6943	Naive Side Effect Tester -- Use a naive side effect analysis even if interprocedural information is available . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to true , Lazy Code Motion uses the conservative side effect information provided by the NaiveSideEffectTester class , even if interprocedural information about side effects is available . The naive side effect analysis is based solely on the information available locally about a statement . It assumes , for example , that any method call has the potential to write and read all instance and static fields in the program . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and Soot is in whole program mode , then Lazy Code Motion uses the side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester class . PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine which fields and statics may be written or read by a given statement . If whole program analysis is not performed , naive side effect information is used regardless of the setting of Naive Side Effect Tester .

7332	Notifies of the presence of a TextDecl line in an entity . If present , this method will be called immediately following the startEntity call . < p/ > < strong > Note : < /strong > This method will never be called for the document entity ; it is only called for external general entities referenced in document content . < p/ > < strong > Note : < /strong > This method is not called for entity references appearing as part of attribute values .
7340	This method is executed just before moving the agent to another location . It is automatically called by the JADE framework . It disposes the GUI and prints a bye message on the standard output .
7341	Read data from reader < code > r < /code > in the appropriate way as determined by our < code > type < /code > . Only XML and Text data can be read from a reader , audio data can not .
7351	Returns a human-readable version of the file size , where the input represents a specific number of bytes . < p > If the size is over 1GB , the size is returned as the number of whole GB , i.e . the size is rounded down to the nearest GB boundary . < /p > < p > Similarly for the 1MB and 1KB boundaries . < /p >

7368	Deletes a file , never throwing an exception . If file is a directory , delete it and all sub-directories . < p/ > The difference between File.delete ( ) and this method are : < ul > < li > A directory to be deleted does not have to be empty. < /li > < li > No exceptions are thrown when a file or directory can not be deleted. < /li > < /ul >
7372	Judge a field is a primitive boolean type or not . Cause it 's a little special when use IDE to generate getter and setter method . The primitive boolean type wo n't be like < b > getXxx < /b > , it 's something like < b > isXxx < /b > .
7379	Should a navigation bar appear at the bottom of the screen in the current device configuration ? A navigation bar may appear on the right side of the screen in certain configurations .

7385	Calculates the size of the full document object , by getting the edge count of the corresponding graph and < i > not < /i > the datastring ( i.e . text ) size .
7424	Returns true if this node is a marker . This method is n't actually called in any current code checking for markers because callers will have already read value field and need to use that read ( not another done here ) and so directly test if value points to node .
7456	A processing instruction . Processing instructions consist of a target name and , optionally , text data . The data is only meaningful to the application . < p/ > Typically , a processing instruction 's data will contain a series of pseudo-attributes . These pseudo-attributes follow the form of element attributes but are < strong > not < /strong > parsed or presented to the application as anything other than text . The application is responsible for parsing the data .
7457	Get the contents of a < code > Reader < /code > as a String . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > .
7476	Mark the present position in the stream . Subsequent calls to reset ( ) will attempt to reposition the stream to this point . Not all character-input streams support the mark ( ) operation .
7490	Returns if the error activity should show a restart button . Note that even if restart is enabled , a valid restart activity could not be found . In that case , a close button will still be used .
7492	Returns true if the given point p is below the given point q . < p > If the point p and q form a horizontal line then p is considered below if its x coordinate is greater than q 's x coordinate .
7493	Notify the scroller that we 've reached a horizontal boundary . Normally the information to handle this will already be known when the animation is started , such as in a call to one of the fling functions . However there are cases where this can not be known in advance . This function will transition the current motion and animate from startX to finalX as appropriate .
7501	Updates the content of a thing shadow with the data provided in the request . This is a blocking call , so the calling thread will be blocked until the operation succeeded or failed . < p > Note : Blocking API call without specifying a timeout , in very rare cases , can block the calling thread indefinitely , if the server response is not received or lost . Use the alternative APIs with timeout for applications that expect responses within fixed duration . < /p >
7506	Remove all keys associated with the store . < p > This is mainly used for tests ; the Redis command used to get the associated keys ( KEYS ) is rather expensive and should n't be run frequently .

7539	Creates a sample set of N minimal buckets for the given experiment . The allocation percentage for each bucket is 1/N . The first bucket ( index 0 ) is the control group . Minimal means that only the required values are set .
7545	Attempts to validate the provided Trigger . If valid , null is returned . Otherwise a list of errors will be returned . < p/ > Note that a Trigger that passes validation here is not necessarily valid in all permutations of a JobParameters . For example , an Immediate is never valid for a recurring job .

7572	Trim Static Initializer Edges -- Removes redundant static initializer calls . The call graph contains an edge from each statement that could trigger execution of a static initializer to that static initializer . However , each static initializer is triggered only once . When this option is enabled , after the call graph is built , an intra-procedural analysis is performed to detect static initializer edges leading to methods that must have already been executed . Since these static initializers can not be executed again , the corresponding call graph edges are removed from the call graph .
7577	Rethrow the exception if it is an Error , unless it is a LinkageError , OutOfMemoryError , or StackOverflowError . Otherwise print the exception stack trace if debugging is enabled .
7579	Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class Class . Before the Class can be used it must be resolved . NOTE : an object representing an class object . To be conservative , the side-effect of this method will return an abstract reference points to all possible class object in current analysis environment . private native java.lang.Class defineClass0 ( java.lang.String , byte [ ] , int , int , java.security.ProtectionDomain ) ;
7588	Remove a tuple from this table . If the Tuple is a member of this table , its row is deleted from the table . Otherwise , nothing is done .

7606	Notifies the attached observers that the underlying data is no longer valid or available . Once invoked this adapter is no longer valid and should not report further data set changes .
7629	Checks whether two filenames are equal exactly . < p > No processing is performed on the filenames other than comparison , thus this is merely a null-safe case-sensitive equals .
7635	The name of the application-wide build system default . This should only be used in situations where it does n't make sense to use the build system associated with the current project ( e.g . the import project action ) .
7660	Visits ( but does not alter ) some entries of this vector in optimized order . The order in which the entries are visited is selected so as to lead to the most efficient implementation ; it might depend on the concrete implementation of this abstract class .
7687	Return the angle at the vertex B in the triangle ABC . The return value is always in the range [ 0 , Pi ] . The points do not need to be normalized . Ensures that Angle ( a , b , c ) == Angle ( c , b , a ) for all a , b , c . The angle is undefined if A or C is diametrically opposite from B , and becomes numerically unstable as the length of edge AB or BC approaches 180 degrees .
7693	Add a split for the current time , labeled with splitLabel . If Log.isLoggable was not enabled to at least the Log.VERBOSE for the specified tag at construction or reset ( ) time then this call does nothing .
7702	Read data from reader < code > r < /code > in the appropriate way as determined by our < code > type < /code > . Only XML and Text data can be read from a reader , audio data can not . `` Helpers '' needed to read the data , such as XML parser objects , are created when they are needed . If doWarnClient is set to true , warning and error messages related to XML parsing are logged to the log category connected to the client from which this request originated .
7705	Query a feature as identified by the given featureName as to whether the given featureValue is a known value of that feature . In other words , this will return true exactly if the given feature is a byte feature and getFeatureValueAsByte ( featureName , featureValue ) will not throw an exception or if the given feature is a short feature and getFeatureValueAsShort ( featureName , featureValue ) will not throw an exception .
7706	Encodes up to the first three bytes of array < var > threeBytes < /var > and returns a four-byte array in Base64 notation . The actual number of significant bytes in your array is given by < var > numSigBytes < /var > . The array < var > threeBytes < /var > needs only be as big as < var > numSigBytes < /var > . Code can reuse a byte array by passing a four-byte array as < var > b4 < /var > .
7709	Set our `` pressed '' state to true and `` down '' state to true. < br > This provides a means to set the state externally , without anyone actually having to press a key on the keyboard .

7719	* Detect human faces in an image and returns face locations , and optionally with face ID , landmarks , and attributes . < p > Optional parameters for returning face ID , landmarks , and attributes . Attributes include age , gender , smile intensity , facial hair and head-pose . Face ID is for other APIs use including Face - Identify , Face - Verify , and Face - Find Similar . The face ID will expire in 24 hours after detection call . JPEG , PNG , GIF ( the first frame ) , and BMP are supported . The image file size should be no larger than 4MB . The detectable face size is between 36x36 to 4096x4096 pixels . The faces out of this range will not be detected . A maximum of 64 faces could be returned for an image . The returned faces are ranked by face rectangle size in descending order . Some faces may not be detected for technical challenges , e.g . very large face angles ( head-pose ) or large occlusion . Frontal and near-frontal faces have the best results . Attributes ( age , gender , headPose , smile and facialHair , and glasses ) are still experimental and may not be very accurate . HeadPose 's pitch value is reserved as 0 .
7724	A type is reifiable if it either refers to a non-parameterized type , is a raw type , is a parameterized type with only unbound wildcard parameters or is an array type with a reifiable type parameter .
7754	A processing instruction . Processing instructions consist of a target name and , optionally , text data . The data is only meaningful to the application . < p/ > Typically , a processing instruction 's data will contain a series of pseudo-attributes . These pseudo-attributes follow the form of element attributes but are < strong > not < /strong > parsed or presented to the application as anything other than text . The application is responsible for parsing the data .
7759	Dump Answer -- Dump computed reaching types for comparison with other solvers . When this option is set to true , the computed reaching types for each variable are dumped to a file , so that they can be compared with the results of other analyses ( such as the old VTA ) .
7762	Returns the set of all < code > Throwable < /code > s as the set of types that a < code > throw < /code > instruction may throw implicitly , that is , the possible types of errors which might arise in the course of executing the < code > throw < /code > instruction , rather than the type of the < code > throw < /code > 's operand .
7764	Checks whether the extension of the filename is that specified . < p > This method obtains the extension as the textual part of the filename after the last dot . There must be no directory separator after the dot . The extension check is case-sensitive on all platforms .
7768	Reject the request . This might be necessary if the client is already processing a large number of requests . If deepstream receives a rejection message it will try to route the request to another provider - or return a NO_RPC_PROVIDER error if there are no providers left
7771	Initializes the ` luceneIndexSearcher ` if it has not been initialized already . < p > Note that the index searcher can not be built at construction time , because it needs the dimension and associated key-value store . However , because of a circular dependency between the ` SearchProvider ` and the ` Dimension ` classes , we can not provide the dimension and key-value store to the search provider at construction time .
7781	Test for the equality of two fractions . If the lowest term numerator and denominators are the same for both fractions , the two fractions are considered to be equal .
7795	Returns true if it appears that log4j have been previously configured . This code checks to see if there are any appenders defined for log4j which is the definitive way to tell if log4j is already initialized
7803	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a character array using the specified character encoding . < p/ > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .

7827	Appends a new member to the end of this object , with the specified name and the JSON representation of the specified < code > boolean < /code > value . < p > This method < strong > does not prevent duplicate names < /strong > . Calling this method with a name that already exists in the object will append another member with the same name . In order to replace existing members , use the method < code > set ( name , value ) < /code > instead . However , < strong > < em > add < /em > is much faster than < em > set < /em > < /strong > ( because it does not need to search for existing members ) . Therefore < em > add < /em > should be preferred when constructing new objects . < /p >
7828	Get the optional boolean value associated with an index . It returns the defaultValue if there is no value at that index or if it is not a Boolean or the String `` true '' or `` false '' ( case insensitive ) .

7936	This method gets called only from the public discard ( ) method . The purpose of this method is to prevent the discard method from being called too frequently . This method measures the time from when the listener 's discovered ( ) method gets called to when its discard ( ) method gets called . If the time is less than MIN_RETRY , the next discovery attempt is delayed .
7947	Serializes a long to a binary stream with zero-compressed encoding . For -112 < = i < = 127 , only one byte is used with the actual value . For other values of i , the first byte value indicates whether the long is positive or negative , and the number of bytes that follow . If the first byte value v is between -113 and -120 , the following long is positive , with number of bytes that follow are - ( v+112 ) . If the first byte value v is between -121 and -128 , the following long is negative , with number of bytes that follow are - ( v+120 ) . Bytes are stored in the high-non-zero-byte-first order .

8016	Puts the named value in the environment . Supports the `` . '' ( dot ) syntax to access Map members and the `` [ ] '' ( bracket ) syntax to access List entries . If the brackets for a list are empty the value will be appended to end of the list , otherwise the value will be set in the position of the number in the brackets . If a `` + '' ( plus sign ) is included inside the square brackets before the index number the value will inserted/added at that index instead of set at that index . This value is expanded , supporting the insertion of other environment values using the `` $ { } '' notation .
8022	This method will be used to read only the last entry of dictionary meta chunk . Applicable scenarios : 1 . Global dictionary generation for incremental load . In this case only the last dictionary chunk meta entry has to be read to calculate min , max surrogate key and start and end offset for the new dictionary chunk . 2 . Truncate operation . While writing dictionary file in case of incremental load dictionary file needs to be validated for any inconsistency . Here end offset of last dictionary chunk meta is validated with file size .
8027	Create instances of the various mission handlers , according to the specifications in the MissionInit object. < br > The Mission object ( inside MissionInit ) contains an optional string for each type of handler , which specifies the class-name of the handler required. < br > This method will attempt to instantiate all the requested objects. < br > Any objects that are left unspecified by the MissionInit , or are unable to be created , are left as null .
8028	Put a key/value pair in the JSONObject , but only if the key and the value are both non-null , and only if there is not already a member with that name .
8029	This method turns on animation . If you want to change animation duration , you need to call this method . If you want to specify a interpolator you can call enableAnimation ( long animationDuration , Interpolator interpolator )
8031	All Application Class Methods Reachable -- Assume all methods of application classes are reachable.. When this option is false , the call graph is built starting at a set of entry points , and only methods reachable from those entry points are processed . Unreachable methods will not have any call graph edges generated out of them . Setting this option to true makes Soot consider all methods of application classes to be reachable , so call edges are generated for all of them . This leads to a larger call graph . For program visualization purposes , it is sometimes desirable to include edges from unreachable methods ; although these methods are unreachable in the version being analyzed , they may become reachable if the program is modified .
8036	Returns a new Token object , by default . However , if you want , you can create and return subclass objects based on the value of ofKind . Simply add the cases to the switch for all those special cases . For example , if you have a subclass of Token called IDToken that you want to create if ofKind is ID , simply add something like : case MyParserConstants.ID : return new IDToken ( ofKind , image ) ; to the following switch statement . Then you can cast matchedToken variable to the appropriate type and use sit in your lexical actions .

8103	Compute the distance from `` a '' to `` b '' in the range [ 0 , 2*Pi ) . This is equivalent to ( drem ( b - a - S2.M_PI , 2 * S2.M_PI ) + S2.M_PI ) , except that it is more numerically stable ( it does not lose precision for very small positive distances ) .
8150	If input filter criteria contains defects reference , then it should be validated on containing defect sub-type additional extension . If there is no defect sub-type , then TOTAL reference will be used. < br > < b > NOTE : < /b > should be used after check on containing < i > statistics.issueCounter < /i > criteria part .

8156	Convert a well-formed ( but not necessarily valid ) XML string into a JSONObject using the JsonML transform . Each XML tag is represented as a JSONObject with a `` tagName '' property . If the tag has attributes , then the attributes will be in the JSONObject as properties . If the tag contains children , the object will have a `` childNodes '' property which will be an array of strings and JsonML JSONObjects . Comments , prologs , DTDs , and < code > & lt ; [ [ ] ] > < /code > are ignored .
8160	Create an < code > unsigned short < /code > by masking it with < code > 0xFFFF < /code > i.e . < code > ( short ) -1 < /code > becomes < code > ( ushort ) 65535 < /code >

First the corresponding field for this column is removed in the class . Second this column is not an id column . Third this column is not a foreign key column .
8221	Get a builder to modify a copy of this history . < p > The builder returned will retain all internal information related to the keys in the history , including their states . It is safe to remove keys from the builder and push them back on ; nothing will be lost in those operations .
8227	Convenience method to construct the minimal interval containing the two given points . This is equivalent to starting with an empty interval and calling AddPoint ( ) twice , but it is more efficient .
8232	Called on startup to run all the DAO object table creation/migration logic . Slight overhead using this technique . TODO Do the migrations inside the sqlite database so the application does not need to
8252	This controls the action to take with the block ( if any ) that was clicked on . This event gets processed for all blocks , but most do n't have a default action
8259	Gets whether high accuracy is enabled , see description in < a href= `` http : //dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html # high-accuracy '' > the W3C spec < /a > . < /br > default false

8338	Fetches the LMDB error code description . < p > End users should not need this method , as LmdbJava converts all LMDB exceptions into a typed Java exception that incorporates the error code . However it is provided here for verification and troubleshooting ( eg if the user wishes to see the original LMDB description of the error code , or there is a newer library version etc ) .
8343	Specify the key columns . The idea here is to be able to create a ( potentially compound ) key out of multiple columns , using the toString representation of the values in these columns
8348	Builds a name of the form `` { build system name } { command name } { target string } '' . Any null components are omitted , and there is always one space inserted between each included component .
8356	Apply this filter to the given input signal . The input signal is filtered piece by piece , as it is read from the data source returned by this method . This is the recommended way to filter longer signals .

You can learn more about < a href= '' https : //api.slack.com/events/file_shared '' > file_shared < /a > event from Slack 's Api documentation .
8362	Attempts to solve the given `` variant selection '' conflict . < p > The conflict is solved by selecting the expected variant in the module that is the source of such conflict . For example , Module1 depends on Module2-VariantX , but Module2 has currently VariantY selected . To solve this conflict , this method selects VariantX on Module2 . < /p > < p > There are cases that a conflict can not be solved without creating new conflicts . For example , Module1 depends on Module3-VariantX while Module2 depends on Module3-VariantY , and Module2 has currently VariantZ selected . Selecting VariantX on Module3 will satisfy Module1 's dependency , but there will still be a conflict with Module2 . In this case , this method shows a dialog explaining the dependencies involved and allows the user to select the variant that would partially solve the conflict . < /p >
8376	< code > mult < /code > multiplies this matrix with another matrix . The results are stored internally and a handle to this matrix will then be returned . This matrix will be on the left hand side , while the parameter matrix will be on the right .

8481	Create lazy points-to sets -- Create lazy points-to sets that create context information only when needed.. When this option is disabled , context information is computed for every query to the reachingObjects method . When it is enabled , a call to reachingObjects returns a lazy wrapper object that contains a context-insensitive points-to set . This set is then automatically refined with context information when necessary , i.e . when we try to determine the intersection with another points-to set and this intersection seems to be non-empty .
8482	When not using EmoInputFormat the default behavior for TextInputFormat is to attempt to split a file unless it is compressed with an unsplittable codec . Since data streamed from EmoDB is not backed by an actual file normal file operations can not be applied to it , such as splitting and seeking . To trick Hadoop into not splitting the file make each split appear to be gzipped .

8551	Manipulates the map once available . This callback is triggered when the map is ready to be used . This is where we can add markers or lines , add listeners or move the camera . In this case , we just add a marker near Sydney , Australia . If Google Play services is not installed on the device , the user will be prompted to install it inside the SupportMapFragment . This method will only be triggered once the user has installed Google Play services and returned to the app .
8563	Performs a < a href= '' http : //www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda353.htm '' > two-sided t-test < /a > evaluating the null hypothesis that the mean of the population from which < code > sample < /code > is drawn equals < code > mu < /code > . < p > Returns < code > true < /code > iff the null hypothesis can be rejected with confidence < code > 1 - alpha < /code > .

8584	< p > Generates a stream that is computed from a provided long stream by first rolling it in the same way as the < code > roll ( ) < /code > method does . Then a summarizing long operation is applied on each substream to form the final long summary stream . No boxing / unboxing is conducted in the process . < p > The resulting stream has the same number of elements as the provided stream , minus the size of the window width , to preserve consistency of each collection . < /p > < p > A < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown if the provided stream is null. < /p >
8585	Precision evaluation methodologies -- Precision evaluation methodologies . We internally provide some precision evaluation methodologies and classify the evaluation strength into three levels . If level is 0 , we do nothing . If level is 1 , we report the statistical information about the points-to result . If level is 2 , we perform the virtual callsite resolution , static cast safety and all-pairs alias evaluations .
8589	This method causes the communication channel to be abruptly closed . Use it carefully , since this one is not thread-safe . It is given as an `` emergency brake '' to close the control connection when it is blocked . A thread-safe solution for the same purpose is a call to disconnect ( false ) .
8590	Tests if the interior of this < code > Polyline2D < /code > entirely contains the specified < code > Rectangle2D < /code > . This method is required to implement the Shape interface , but in the case of Line2D objects it always returns false since a line contains no area .
8603	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . < p/ > This should only be used on AdapterView 's such as ListView as it just calls through to overScrollBy ( ) with the scrollRange = 0 . AdapterView 's do not have a scroll range ( i.e . getScrollY ( ) does n't work ) .
8616	Converts this rich text to another rich text . The default implementation does n't support any conversion except the one to itself ( which is technically no conversion ) . < p > The method has to make sure that the original rich text is n't modified . It does however not make sure that the returned RTText is n't referencing the original RTText meaning modifying the resulting object might also modify the original object .
8627	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a < code > byte [ ] < /code > . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .

8639	NOT IMPLEMENTED - CURRENTLY HANDLED BY CustomerEvents.xml # checkCreateUpdateAnonUser . < p > Creates/updates an anon user for checkoutoptions if a form was submitted containing a request to create one ( createNewUser `` Y '' ) . < p > Currently it will always create a new anon user if the screen requested it . This at least may prevent ( or cause ! ) some issues with session . < p > It will use a minimal set of info ( first and last name ) to create the Person ; the rest should be handled by other events . < p > It stores the fake userLogin ( userLoginId `` anonymous '' , partyId to a new party ) in session . < p > Based on CustomerEvents.xml # processCustomerSettings .
8645	Get an iterator over map elements . < p > The specialized iterators returned are fail-fast : they throw a < code > ConcurrentModificationException < /code > when they detect the map has been modified during iteration. < /p >
8657	TODO : < p > Create the stream of integers [ 1..100000 ] and apply next functions : 1 ) Multiply all elements by 2 2 ) Remove 40 000 elements from start and 40 000 elements from end 3 ) Remove all values which is not divided by 3 4 ) Find multiplication of all values in the stream and transform into one single BigInteger 5 ) Operations above are rather slow . Try to calculate result in observable only once . You code will be also tested for speed - you should n't recalculate result for each new subscriber .

8736	Local Name Standardization -- Uses naming scheme of the Local Name Standardizer.. If enabled , the Local Name Standardizer is applied whenever Shimple creates new locals . Normally , Shimple will retain the original local names as far as possible and use an underscore notation to denote SSA subscripts . This transformation does not otherwise affect Shimple behaviour .
8756	Add new page to adapter . Call method onNewItemsAdded which check size of array and compute mAllItemsLoaded , if items.size ( ) < mPageSize then hide bottom progress and no more show it .
8763	All Application Class Methods Reachable -- Assume all methods of application classes are reachable.. When this option is false , the call graph is built starting at a set of entry points , and only methods reachable from those entry points are processed . Unreachable methods will not have any call graph edges generated out of them . Setting this option to true makes Soot consider all methods of application classes to be reachable , so call edges are generated for all of them . This leads to a larger call graph . For program visualization purposes , it is sometimes desirable to include edges from unreachable methods ; although these methods are unreachable in the version being analyzed , they may become reachable if the program is modified .
8783	Request the node neighbor list to be updated for the specified node . Once this is complete , the requestNodeRoutingInfo will be called automatically to update the data in the binding .
8794	Returns true if the given PsiElement is a reference to an Android Resource . The element can either be an identifier such as y in R.x.y , or the expression R.x.y itself .

9137	When performing initial load , this flag indicates if the generated query will order to results by the id . By default set to < code > true < /code > as it most times results in better initial load performance .
9143	Convert the specified CharSequence to an input stream , encoded as bytes using the specified character encoding . < p/ > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > .
9144	Mark file we just uploaded for cleanup later . We do not immediately delete the file for testing reasons , but if marking the file fails , we do delete it right away .
9148	Write many log records to the stream . The return type here is unfortunate but its a direct result of having to combine FuturePool and the asyncWriteBulk method which returns a future as well . The problem is the List that asyncWriteBulk returns ca n't be materialized until getLogSegmentWriter completes , so it has to be wrapped in a future itself .
9162	Ensures the counter is at least as high as the specified value . The counter should always point to an unused ID ( which will be handed out next time a request comes in ) . Exposed so that anything externally loading tabs and ids can set enforce new tabs start at the correct id .

9190	Inference with the given document . Given the input document , which is a list of words , the method outputs the assignment of topics , the document 's aggregated distribution over topics , and return the log-likelihood . If the model is unlocked , which means in training mode , we will use the values in [ ] topics to initialize the model parameters . If any element in [ ] topics is less than 0 , we help fill the [ ] topics with random topics . If the model is locked , we will not update the model parameters with the content of [ ] topics .

If and on only if it begins a transaction it will return true . In other words , if a transaction is already in place it will return false and do nothing .
9221	Returns true if facade may be created for the specified table and placement . Throws an exception if a facade is not allowed because of a conflict with the master or another facade . Returns false if there is already a facade at the specified placement , so facade creation would be idempotent .
9233	Returns the days between two dates . Positive values indicate that the second date is after the first , and negative values indicate , well , the opposite . Relying on specific times is problematic .
9241	A single preview frame will be returned to the handler supplied . The data will arrive as byte [ ] in the message.obj field , with width and height encoded as message.arg1 and message.arg2 , respectively .
9257	Schedules the Activity corresponding to the afterKey to always be run immediately after the completion of the Activity corresponding to the beforeKey . This method has no scheduling effect on the Activity corresponding to the before key .
9262	Release a write lock , wait the given period of time or until notified by notifier , then obtain a regular write lock again . Throws ConcurrentLockException if the thread gets interrupted ; in that case , the write lock is still held .
9267	< p > Returns the URI mapping in the catalog for the given external identifier or < code > null < /code > if no mapping exists . Public identifiers are normalized before comparison. < /p >
9268	Creates an observable list which contains the items of the given observable list , filtered by a given filter criterion . The function is applied to all items in the list to obtain an observable boolean which is determines whether the item is included in the filtered list or not . The item will be included when the observable boolean is < code > false < /code > .
9271	Method Context Counts ( Totals only ) -- Print number of contexts for each method . Causes Paddle to print the number of contexts and number of context equivalence classes split out by method . Requires total-context-counts to also be turned on .
9272	Modifies the category so as to merge documents as negative examples . The category converges in rejecting the given type of documents , with a speed described by a learning rate parameter .
9279	Element depth iz zero . This methos is a hook for subclasses to add code to handle when the element depth hits zero . When scanning a document fragment , an element depth of zero is normal . However , when scanning a full XML document , the scanner must handle the trailing miscellanous section of the document after the end of the document 's root element .
9282	This method is executed just before moving the agent to another location . It is automatically called by the JADE framework . It disposes the GUI and prints a bye message on the standard output .
9288	Among the children that are suitable to be considered as an anchor child , returns the one closest to the start of the layout . < p > Due to ambiguous adapter updates or children being removed , some children 's positions may be invalid . This method is a best effort to find a position within adapter bounds if possible . < p > It also prioritizes children that are within the visible bounds .
9290	Print the matrix to stdout . Line the elements up in columns . Use the format object , and right justify within columns of width characters . Note that is the matrix is to be read back in , you probably will want to use a NumberFormat that is set to US Locale .
9298	Fractional parameter -- Fractional parameter for precision/performance trade-off . This option specifies the fractional parameter , which manually balances the precision and the performance . Smaller value means better performance and worse precision .
9302	CalculateSortedRank : calculate the rank of each example , after sorting example . For example , we might have some numerical `` score '' column , and we want to know for the rank ( sort order ) for each example , according to that column. < br > The rank of each example ( after sorting ) will be added in a new Long column . Indexing is done from 0 ; examples will have values 0 to dataSetSize-1. < br > < p > Currently , CalculateSortedRank can only be applied on standard ( i.e. , non-sequence ) data Furthermore , the current implementation can only sort on one column
9313	Adds a set of locators to the managed set of locators . Elements in the input set that duplicate ( using the < code > LookupLocator.equals < /code > method ) elements already in the managed set will be ignored . If the empty array is input , the managed set of locators will not change .
9320	Print the current spacing ( determined by the indentation level ) into the document . This method is used by many of the other formatting methods , and so should only need to be called in the case of custom text printing outside the mechanisms provided by this class .
9322	Writes a String to a file creating the file if it does not exist . NOTE : As from v1.3 , the parent directories of the file will be created if they do not exist .
9325	Use to get recommendations based on a particular audio file . The ID of the user or community that owns an audio file and that audio file 's ID , separated by an underscore .
9337	Copy chars from a < code > Reader < /code > to a < code > Writer < /code > . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > . < p/ > Large streams ( over 2GB ) will return a chars copied value of < code > -1 < /code > after the copy has completed since the correct number of chars can not be returned as an int . For large streams use the < code > copyLarge ( Reader , Writer ) < /code > method .
9379	Returns a new Token object , by default . However , if you want , you can create and return subclass objects based on the value of ofKind . Simply add the cases to the switch for all those special cases . For example , if you have a subclass of Token called IDToken that you want to create if ofKind is ID , simlpy add something like : case MyParserConstants.ID : return new IDToken ( ) ; to the following switch statement . Then you can cast matchedToken variable to the appropriate type and use it in your lexical actions .
9449	< p > Compute < code > value*signum < /code > where < code > value==null < /code > is treated as < code > value==0 < /code > < /p > .
9462	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . This version of the call is used for Views that need to specify a Scroll Range but scroll back to it 's edge correctly .
9463	Adds margins to left/right ( or top/bottom in horizontal orientation ) < p > Top padding ( or left padding in horizontal orientation ) with clipToPadding = true is not supported . If you need to offset the top ( or left in horizontal orientation ) and do not want scrolling children to be visible , use margins .
9492	A processing instruction . Processing instructions consist of a target name and , optionally , text data . The data is only meaningful to the application . < p/ > Typically , a processing instruction 's data will contain a series of pseudo-attributes . These pseudo-attributes follow the form of element attributes but are < strong > not < /strong > parsed or presented to the application as anything other than text . The application is responsible for parsing the data .
9495	Flips the given polygon about the given line and returns the result as a new polygon . < p > This method assumes that the line is through the origin .
9497	Inserts an attribute-value pair about the OMA content . If the attribute already exists , the new value will replace the old one . For MIME type , it will be appended to the existing MIME types .
9508	Merge String Buffer -- Represent all StringBuffers as one object . When this option is set to true , all allocation sites creating java.lang.StringBuffer objects are grouped together as a single allocation site .
9509	Get the appropriate set of URLs . This returns a set of URLs for a given set of package prefixes . You can use an empty string to get everything but it can be slow for big apps .
9514	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a String using the specified character encoding . < p/ > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
9516	Serializes an object and returns the Base64-encoded version of that serialized object . < p > As of v 2.3 , if the object can not be serialized or there is another error , the method will throw an java.io.IOException . < b > This is new to v2.3 ! < /b > In earlier versions , it just returned a null value , but in retrospect that 's a pretty poor way to handle it . < /p > The object is not GZip-compressed before being encoded .
9522	Calling this will disable the custom legend labels ( set by setCustom ( ... ) ) . Instead , the labels will again be calculated automatically ( after notifyDataSetChanged ( ) is called ) .
9534	Checks whether two filenames are equal exactly . < p > No processing is performed on the filenames other than comparison , thus this is merely a null-safe case-sensitive equals .
9556	Make a JSON text of this JSONArray . For compactness , no unnecessary whitespace is added . If it is not possible to produce a syntactically correct JSON text then null will be returned instead . This could occur if the array contains an invalid number . < p > Warning : This method assumes that the signalData structure is acyclical .
9557	Computes the visibility sorting value based on the tab visible area , its distance to the central index and the overall visibility of the stack . The '-index ' index factor need to be smaller for stack that have small visibility . Multiplying by a small stackVisibility makes it bigger ( because it is negative ) , hence the division . To avoid dividing by 0 it need to be offset a bit . 0.1f is the ' a bit ' part of the explanation .
9563	Copy the instance . < p > The instance created is completely independant of the original one . A deep copy is used , none of the underlying objects are shared ( except for immutable objects ) . < /p >
9577	Return true if and only if the interior of this cap intersects the given other cap . ( This relationship is not symmetric , since only the interior of this cap is used . )
9593	Method will find whether the expression needs to be resolved , this can happen if the expression is exclude and data type is null ( mainly in IS NOT NULL filter scenario )
9594	Deletes a set of locators from the managed set of locators , and discards any already-discovered lookup service that corresponds to a deleted locator . For any lookup service that is discarded as a result of an invocation of this method , a discard notification is sent ; and that lookup service will not be eligible for re-discovery ( assuming it is not currently eligible for discovery through other means , such as group discovery ) . < p > If the empty array is input , this method takes no action .
9632	Indicates whether the audio data is stored in big-endian or little-endian byte order . If the sample size is not more than one byte , the return value is irrelevant .
9638	If somebody is unlucky enough to have to serialize one of these , serialize it as a BigDecimal so that they wo n't need Gson on the other side to deserialize it .
9664	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to the specified < code > File < /code > line by line . The default VM encoding and the default line ending will be used .
9671	This method notifies the end of a general entity . < p/ > < strong > Note : < /strong > This method is not called for entity references appearing as part of attribute values .
9673	Visits ( but does not alter ) all entries of this vector in optimized order . The order in which the entries are visited is selected so as to lead to the most efficient implementation ; it might depend on the concrete implementation of this abstract class .
9682	Removes and returns a key-value mapping associated with the least key in this map , or < tt > null < /tt > if the map is empty . The returned entry does < em > not < /em > support the < tt > Entry.setValue < /tt > method .
9686	Add a listener for changes to this flag . Whenever the flag is changed ( parsed from command line , or set dynamically ) , the given listener will be called .
9689	Performs a < a href= '' http : //www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section4/prc45.htm '' > chi-square test of independence < /a > evaluating the null hypothesis that the classifications represented by the counts in the columns of the input 2-way table are independent of the rows , with significance level < code > alpha < /code > . Returns true iff the null hypothesis can be rejected with 100 * ( 1 - alpha ) percent confidence . < p > The rows of the 2-way table are < code > count [ 0 ] , ... , count [ count.length - 1 ] < /code > < p > < strong > Example : < /strong > < br > To test the null hypothesis that the counts in < code > count [ 0 ] , ... , count [ count.length - 1 ] < /code > all correspond to the same underlying probability distribution at the 99 % level , use < code > chiSquareTest ( counts , 0.01 ) < /code > . < p > < strong > Preconditions < /strong > : < ul > < li > All counts must be & ge ; 0. < /li > < li > The count array must be rectangular ( i.e . all count [ i ] subarrays must have the same length ) . < /li > < li > The 2-way table represented by < code > counts < /code > must have at least 2 columns and at least 2 rows. < /li > < /ul > < p > If any of the preconditions are not met , an < code > IllegalArgumentException < /code > is thrown .
9721	Formats a time value to String . Use this method to make sure the value appears in the same format as used in the chart ( tooltip ) . Useful for updating details area . < br > < br > < b > Note : < /b > This method must be called in the Event Dispatch Thread .
9723	Adds a < code > DataTagUpdateListener < /code > to the Tag and generates an initial update event for that listener . Any change to the Tag value or quality attributes will trigger an update event to all < code > DataTagUpdateListener < /code > objects registered .
9737	Formats a percent value to String . Use this method to make sure the value appears in the same format as used in the chart ( tooltip ) . Useful for updating details area . < br > < br > < b > Note : < /b > This method must be called in the Event Dispatch Thread .
9739	Set the Sounds to be played when a Pull Event happens . You specify which sound plays for which events by calling this method multiple times for each event . < p/ > If you 've already set a sound for a certain event , and add another sound for that event , only the new sound will be played .
9741	This method notifies the start of a general entity . < p/ > < strong > Note : < /strong > This method is not called for entity references appearing as part of attribute values .
9743	Maximum width of the control in pixels . The width is set dynamically to show round values ( e.g . 100 , 200 , 500 ) . < /br > default 100
9744	Visits ( and possibly alters ) all entries of this vector in optimized order . The order in which the entries are visited is selected so as to lead to the most efficient implementation ; it might depend on the concrete implementation of this abstract class .
9763	For methods , restore creates a return from the dispatch call , to exit the method once the new implementation has been executed . for void methods , this is an empty return and for all other methods , it returns the value from the dispatch call . < p/ > Note that the generated bytecode does not have a direct translation to code , but as an example , this restore implementation in combination with the base class generates the following for methods with avoid return type : < code > if ( $ change ! = null ) { $ change.access $ dispatch ( $ name , new object [ ] { arg0 , ... argsN } ) return ; } $ originalMethodBody < /code > and the following for methods with a non-void return type : < code > if ( $ change ! = null ) { return $ change.access $ dispatch ( $ name , new object [ ] { arg0 , ... argsN } ) } $ originalMethodBody < /code >
9767	Erase a purchase ( locally ) from the inventory , given its product ID . This just modifies the Inventory object locally and has no effect on the server ! This is useful when you have an existing Inventory object which you know to be up to date , and you have just consumed an item successfully , which means that erasing its purchase data from the Inventory you already have is quicker than querying for a new Inventory .
9790	Returns a new Token object , by default . However , if you want , you can create and return subclass objects based on the value of ofKind . Simply add the cases to the switch for all those special cases . For example , if you have a subclass of Token called IDToken that you want to create if ofKind is ID , simlpy add something like : case MyParserConstants.ID : return new IDToken ( ) ; to the following switch statement . Then you can cast matchedToken variable to the appropriate type and use it in your lexical actions .
9806	Mark the present position in the stream . Subsequent calls to reset ( ) will attempt to reposition the stream to this point . Not all character-input streams support the mark ( ) operation .
9807	Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present ( optional operation ) . More formally , if this map contains a mapping from key < tt > k < /tt > to value < tt > v < /tt > such that < code > ( key==null ? k==null : key.equals ( k ) ) < /code > , that mapping is removed . ( The map can contain at most one such mapping . ) < p/ > < p > Returns the value to which this map previously associated the key , or < tt > null < /tt > if the map contained no mapping for the key . < p/ > < p > If this map permits null values , then a return value of < tt > null < /tt > does not < i > necessarily < /i > indicate that the map contained no mapping for the key ; it 's also possible that the map explicitly mapped the key to < tt > null < /tt > . < p/ > < p > The map will not contain a mapping for the specified key once the call returns .
9812	Ad format : 1 - image and text ; 2 - big image ; 3 - exclusive format ; 4 - community , square image ; 7 - special app format .
9813	Assumes that the `` Create Page '' dialog has been already opened and creates a new page based on provided the values . During creation specified template is used in CreatePageWindow .
9820	Returns a constraint representing the specified alternative constraints , with duplicate constraints removed . If a single constraint remains after duplicates are removed , then that constraint is returned , otherwise an instance of < code > ConstraintAlternatives < /code > containing the remaining constraints is returned . The argument passed to this method is neither modified nor retained ; subsequent changes to that argument have no effect on the instance created .
9836	Logs the historic number of times that a Tap gesture triggered the peeking promo for users that have never opened the panel . This should be called periodically for undecided users only .
9838	Get an optional long value associated with a key , or the default if there is no such key or if the value is not a number . If the value is a string , an attempt will be made to evaluate it as a number .
9840	We have to assume all possible classes will be returned . But it is still possible to make a new class . NOTE : assuming a close world , and this method should not be called . private static native java.lang.Class defineClass0 ( java.lang.ClassLoader , java.lang.String , byte [ ] , int , int ) ;
9845	Sets bitmap processor which will be process bitmaps before they will be cached in memory . So memory cache will contain bitmap processed by incoming preProcessor. < br / > Image will be pre-processed even if caching in memory is disabled .
9850	Registers an identifier name with a specified element node . If the identifier is already registered , the new element node replaces the previous node . If the specified element node is null , removeIdentifier ( ) is called .
9852	Indicates if a given String is a URL string . Checks to see if the string begins with the `` http : / '' , `` ftp : / '' , or `` file : / '' protocol strings .
9858	Method providing support for a stack structure having request scope , with fallback to globals . < p > < strong > Do not access underlying structure directly. < /strong > < p > Return value may or may not be a < code > TemplateModel < /code > ; caller must wrap or unwrap as needed .
9870	Provides a direct way for the owner of the integrated server to send a new mission init message. < br > Do n't call this unless the server has been initialised first .
9876	Checks if the init method was called for any instance of this servlet . < p > This can be used as a workaround to detect the approximate point at which the webapp was loaded .
9882	Ignore wrong static-ness -- Ignores errors due to wrong staticness . Some projects have been shown to contain invalid bytecode that tries to access a static field or method in a non-static way or the other way around . The VM 's bytecode verifier will reject such bytecode when loaded into the VM . This option , when enabled , causes to create Jimple bodies in such cases nontheless , ignoring the error .
9884	Disconnect the client from the server . This is a blocking call , so the calling thread will be blocked until the operation succeeded or failed . < p > Note : Blocking API call without specifying a timeout , in very rare cases , can block the calling thread indefinitely , if the server response is not received or lost . Use the alternative APIs with timeout for applications that expect responses within fixed duration . < /p >
9888	Returns the index of the last directory separator character . < p > This method will handle a file in either Unix or Windows format . The position of the last forward or backslash is returned . < p > The output will be the same irrespective of the machine that the code is running on .
9890	Computes a hash code based on the contents of the points-to set . Note that hashCode ( ) is not overwritten on purpose . This is because Spark relies on comparison by object identity .
9892	Provides access to the value of the mapping at the iterator 's position . Note that you must < tt > advance ( ) < /tt > the iterator at least once before invoking this method .
9898	Increments the iteration count by one , and throws an exception if the maximum number of iterations is reached . This method should be called at the beginning of a new iteration .
9923	Make a name/id for the Mindmaps < code > RelationType < /code > representing a relation b/w an entity ( OWL individual ) and its resource ( the OWL data property )
9931	If transmission policy was defined in cluster xml , then < code > true < /code > is returned ; otherwise < code > false < /code > indicating that there is no transmission policy .
9934	Creates the resulting combined configuration . This method is called by < code > getConfiguration ( ) < /code > . It checks whether the < code > header < /code > section of the configuration definition file contains a < code > result < /code > element . If this is the case , it will be used to initialize the properties of the newly created configuration object .
9936	Associates < b > memoryCacheKey < /b > with < b > imageAware < /b > . Then it helps to define image URI is loaded into View at exact moment .
9949	Returns true if this element type can contain another element type . That is , if any of the models in this element 's model vector match any of the models in the other element type 's member-of vector .
9979	Get an optional boolean associated with a key . It returns false if there is no such key , or if the value is not Boolean.TRUE or the String `` true '' .
9983	Creates a view of this instance using the given API Key and sharing the same underlying resources . Note that this method may return a new instance so the caller must use the returned value .
9995	SAX ContentHandler API . < p/ > < p > Captured here only to detect the end of the prolog so that we can ignore subsequent oasis-xml-catalog PIs . Otherwise the events are just passed through. < /p >
10003	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a character array using the specified character encoding . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
10026	Removes the Entry object closest to the given DataSet at the specified index . Returns true if an Entry was removed , false if no Entry was found that meets the specified requirements .
10045	Retrieve the training status of a person group ( completed or ongoing ) . < p > Training can be triggered by the Person Group - Train Person Group API . The training will process for a while on the server side .
10060	inserts a clone of < code > toClone < /code > after < code > node < /code > in the < code > unitChain < /code > . < br > Everything is done in Jimple .
10067	Checks whether the extension of the filename is that specified . < p > This method obtains the extension as the textual part of the filename after the last dot . There must be no directory separator after the dot . The extension check is case-sensitive on all platforms .
10069	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . < p/ > This should only be used on AdapterView 's such as ListView as it just calls through to overScrollBy ( ) with the scrollRange = 0 . AdapterView 's do not have a scroll range ( i.e . getScrollY ( ) does n't work ) .
10073	Add a fixed view to appear at the top of the list . If addHeaderView is called more than once , the views will appear in the order they were added . Views added using this call can take focus if they want . < p > NOTE : Call this before calling setAdapter . This is so ListView can wrap the supplied cursor with one that will also account for header and footer views .
10077	Recursively locate the child that leads to the leaf node . If a key spans multiple pages and findFirst is true , this method returns the first leaf that contains the key . Otherwise , it returns the last leaf that contains the key .
10079	When the client calls discard or delete on a record , there is a short delay before the corresponding ACK message is received from the server . To avoid race conditions if the record is re-requested straight away the old record is removed from the cache straight awy and will only listen for one last ACK message
10081	Returns the < i > observed significance level < /i > , or < a href= `` http : //www.cas.lancs.ac.uk/glossary_v1.1/hyptest.html # pvalue '' > p-value < /a > , associated with a < a href= '' http : //www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35f.htm '' > Chi-square goodness of fit test < /a > comparing the < code > observed < /code > frequency counts to those in the < code > expected < /code > array . < p > The number returned is the smallest significance level at which one can reject the null hypothesis that the observed counts conform to the frequency distribution described by the expected counts . < p > < strong > Preconditions < /strong > : < ul > < li > Expected counts must all be positive. < /li > < li > Observed counts must all be & ge ; 0. < /li > < li > The observed and expected arrays must have the same length and their common length must be at least 2. < /li > < /ul > < p > If any of the preconditions are not met , an < code > IllegalArgumentException < /code > is thrown . < p > < strong > Note : < /strong > This implementation rescales the < code > expected < /code > array if necessary to ensure that the sum of the expected and observed counts are equal .
10095	Renders the named screen using the render environment configured when this ScreenRenderer was created . < p > SCIPIO : modified for asString boolean which returns as string instead of going straight to writer .
10110	Insert Redundant Casts -- . Insert extra casts for the Java bytecode verifier . If the target method uses its this parameter , a reference to the receiver object must be passed to the static copy of the target method . The verifier may complain if the declared type of the receiver parameter does not match the type implementing the target method . Say , for example , that Singer is an interface declaring the sing ( ) method and that the call graph shows all receiver objects at a particular call site , singer.sing ( ) ( with singer declared as a Singer ) are in fact Bird objects ( Bird being a class that implements Singer ) . The virtual call singer.sing ( ) is effectively replaced with the static call Bird.staticsing ( singer ) . Bird.staticsing ( ) may perform operations on its parameter which are only allowed on Birds , rather than Singers . The Insert Redundant Casts option inserts a cast of singer to the Bird type , to prevent complaints from the verifier .
10124	Checks if a GL account is of a specified GlAccountClass.glAccountClassId . Returns false if account is null . It 's better to use the more specific calls like isDebitAccount ( ) .
10135	Returns the number of files currently being used to store the values in this cache . This may be greater than the max file count if a background deletion is pending .
10142	Resets this < code > Polyline2D < /code > object to an empty polygon . The coordinate arrays and the data in them are left untouched but the number of points is reset to zero to mark the old vertex data as invalid and to start accumulating new vertex data at the beginning . All internally-cached data relating to the old vertices are discarded . Note that since the coordinate arrays from before the reset are reused , creating a new empty < code > Polyline2D < /code > might be more memory efficient than resetting the current one if the number of vertices in the new polyline data is significantly smaller than the number of vertices in the data from before the reset .
10148	Creates the directory named by the trailing filename of this file , including the complete directory path required to create this directory . < br/ > < br/ > < ul > < strong > Attentions : < /strong > < li > makeDirs ( `` C : \\Users\\Trinea '' ) can only create users folder < /li > < li > makeFolder ( `` C : \\Users\\Trinea\\ '' ) can create Trinea folder < /li > < /ul >
10152	List of services or websites ( e.g. , `` twitter '' , `` facebook '' ) to which the check-in will be exported , if the user has set up the respective option .
10184	Convert the specified string to an input stream , encoded as bytes using the specified character encoding . < p/ > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > .
10192	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a list of Strings , one entry per line , using the specified character encoding . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
10204	Mark the present position in the stream . Subsequent calls to reset ( ) will attempt to reposition the stream to this point . Not all character-input streams support the mark ( ) operation .
10207	Returns the binding for the system table placement . This implementation piggy-backs on the system table placement from the DataStore configuration . This is n't optimal since it 's violating separation of concerns , but until there is a globally accessible system table placement available for injection this will have to suffice .
10212	This method searches the set of discovered LocatorReg objects for the element that contains the given ServiceRegistrar object . Upon finding such an element , the corresponding LookupLocator is returned ; otherwise , null is returned .
10244	Returns whether this image overlay should be painted with a drop shadow . This is usually the case , but not for transparent themes like the dialog theme ( Theme . *Dialog ) , which already provides its own shadow .
10253	Insert a record of a MARY request producing data of output type AUDIO into the cache . If a record with the same lookup keys ( i.e. , all parameters everything except audio ) exists already , this call does nothing .
10255	This function handles collecting device data for reporting to the shadow . By default , it invokes the getter methods provided for the annotated device attributes .

10825	Returns a flow set representing the initial set of the entry node . In our case the entry node is the last node and it should contain the empty set .
10840	Orders the IDC to move to a target rotation . This will set the rotational velocity to 0 . If setTargetRotation is called before a previous order has completed , the old order will be interrupted , and rotation will continue to the new order from whatever rotation it was at when interrupted . This method causes the IDC to sweep its rotation between its current rotation , and the target rotation . The target rotation is *NOT* globally relative ; it is instead relative to the rotation of its parent . Consider a carousel with a grandfather clock standing on it . The cabinet and the carousel would be represented with 1 IDC , and the hands of the clock would be each represented with an IDC . Let the carousel be still and at its default position , with the clock facing NORTH . When it is 12 o'clock , the hand will have zero rotation , and when it 's 6 o'clock , the hand will have half a turn around the NORTH axis . Using this method to order rotations between 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock will have the natural , desired effect . However , using setRotation or setRotationalVelocity can result in the hand not being flush with the face of the clock , since those methods are relative to the world .

In this case , we just add a marker near Sydney , Australia . If Google Play services is not installed on the device , the user will be prompted to install it inside the SupportMapFragment . This method will only be triggered once the user has installed Google Play services and returned to the app .
11028	Set a custom empty view , this can be done via XML or programmatically using setEmptyLayout ( int layoutId ) If not custom empty view is assigned , the default view will be inflated
11030	Not Main Entry -- Instrument runBenchmark ( ) instead of main ( ) . Insert the calls to the MultiCounter at the beginning and end of methods with the signature long runBenchmark ( java.lang.String [ ] ) instead of the signature void main ( java.lang.String [ ] ) .

11039	Serializes an integer to a binary stream with zero-compressed encoding . For -120 < = i < = 127 , only one byte is used with the actual value . For other values of i , the first byte value indicates whether the integer is positive or negative , and the number of bytes that follow . If the first byte value v is between -121 and -124 , the following integer is positive , with number of bytes that follow are - ( v+120 ) . If the first byte value v is between -125 and -128 , the following integer is negative , with number of bytes that follow are - ( v+124 ) . Bytes are stored in the high-non-zero-byte-first order .
11041	Add a representative face to a person for identification . The input face is specified as an image with a targetFace rectangle . It returns an persistedFaceId representing the added face and this persistedFaceId will not expire . < p > The persistedFaceId is only used in Face - Identify and Person - Delete a Person Face Each person has a maximum of 248 faces . < p > JPEG , PNG , GIF ( the first frame ) , and BMP are supported . The image file size should be no larger than 4MB . < p > The detectable face size is between 36x36 to 4096x4096 pixels . The faces out of this range will not be detected . < p > Rectangle specified by targetFace should contain exactly one face . Zero or multiple faces will be regarded as an error . Out of detectable face size , large head-pose , or very large occlusions will also result in fail to add a person face . < p > The given rectangle specifies both face location and face size at the same time . There is no guarantee of corrent result if you are using rectangle which are not returned from Face - Detect .

11069	Insert Null Checks -- . Insert , before the inlined body of the target method , a check that throws a NullPointerException if the receiver object is null . This ensures that inlining will not eliminate exceptions which would have occurred in its absence .
11082	Treat EMPTY as Alloc -- Treat singletons for empty sets etc . as allocation sites . When this option is set to true , Spark treats references to EMPTYSET , EMPTYMAP , and EMPTYLIST as allocation sites for HashSet , HashMap and LinkedList objects respectively , and references to Hashtable.emptyIterator as allocation sites for Hashtable.EmptyIterator . This enables subsequent analyses to differentiate different uses of Java 's immutable empty collections .

Return false to block the request : if any plugin returns false , Cordova will block the request . If all plugins return null , the default policy will be enforced . If at least one plugin returns true , and no plugins return false , then the request will proceed . Note that this only affects resource requests which are routed through WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest , such as XMLHttpRequest requests and img tag loads . WebSockets and media requests ( such as < video > and < audio > tags ) are not affected by this method . Use CSP headers to control access to such resources .
11229	< p > Encodes data from the given input stream and writes them in the given output stream , wrapping every encoded line every < em > wrapAt < /em > characters .

11240	Divide candidate faces into groups based on face similarity . The output is one or more disjointed face groups and a messyGroup . A face group contains faces that have similar looking , often of the same person . Face groups are ranked by group size , i.e . number of faces . Notice that faces belonging to a same person might be split into several groups in the result . MessyGroup is a special face group containing faces that can not find any similar counterpart face from original faces . The messyGroup will not appear in the result if all faces found their counterparts . Group API needs at least 2 candidate faces and 1000 at most . We suggest to try Face - Verify when you only have 2 candidate faces .

11586	Use older type assigner -- Enables the older type assigner . This enables the older type assigner that was in use until May 2008 . The current type assigner is a reimplementation by Ben Bellamy that uses an entirely new and faster algorithm which always assigns the most narrow type possible . If compare-type-assigners is on , this option causes the older type assigner to execute first . ( Otherwise the newer one is executed first . )
11592	Notify the scroller that we 've reached a vertical boundary .

The combination of 20 pixels and 0.9f ensures that the output is not more than 2 pixels away from the target . TODO : This has nothing to do with time , just draw rate . Is this okay or do we want to have the interpolation based on the time elapsed ?
12621	Finds the implementation Class object in the specified order . The specified order is the following : < ol > < li > query the system property using < code > System.getProperty < /code > < li > read < code > META-INF/services/ < i > factoryId < /i > < /code > file < li > use fallback classname < /ol >
12628	Skip over bytes in the stream . See the general contract of the < code > skipBytes < /code > method of < code > DataInput < /code > . < p/ > Bytes for this operation are read from the contained input stream .
12639	This operation recognizes content within an image by applying a domain-specific model . < p > The list of domain-specific models that are supported by the Computer Vision API can be retrieved using the /models GET request . < p > Currently , the API only provides a single domain-specific model : celebrities .
12643	Close the view if it 's showing , or do n't show it if it is n't showing yet . You do not normally have to call this . Normally view will disappear on its own after the appropriate duration .
12647	Returns an iterator to navigate the elements of the array . Since the array is an ordered list , the iterator navigates the elements in the order they were inserted .
12659	Make sure the locals in this body all have unique String names . If the standard-local-names option is specified to Shimple , this results in the LocalNameStandardizer being applied . Otherwise , renaming is kept to a minimum and an underscore notation is used to differentiate locals previously of the same name .
12662	Global Nodes in Simulated Natives -- Use global node to model variables in simulations of native methods . The simulations of native methods such as System.arraycopy ( ) use temporary local variable nodes . Setting this switch to true causes them to use global variable nodes instead , reducing precision . The switch exists only to make it possible to measure this effect on precision ; there is no other practical reason to set it to true .
12677	If somebody is unlucky enough to have to serialize one of these , serialize it as a LinkedHashMap so that they wo n't need Gson on the other side to deserialize it . Using serialization defeats our DoS defence , so most apps should n't use it .
12680	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . This version of the call is used for Views that need to specify a Scroll Range but scroll back to it 's edge correctly .

12754	Pre Jimplify -- Jimplify all methods before starting Spark . When this option is set to true , Spark converts all available methods to Jimple before starting the points-to analysis . This allows the Jimplification time to be separated from the points-to time . However , it increases the total time and memory requirement , because all methods are Jimplified , rather than only those deemed reachable by the points-to analysis .
12755	Default implementation will write type prefix , call regular serialization method ( since assumption is that value itself does not need JSON Array or Object start/end markers ) , and then write type suffix . This should work for most cases ; some sub-classes may want to change this behavior .
12769	Compares this object with the specified object for order . Returns a negative integer , zero , or a positive integer as this object is less than , equal to , or greater than the specified object . < p/ > < p > The implementor must ensure < tt > sgn ( x.compareTo ( y ) ) == -sgn ( y.compareTo ( x ) ) < /tt > for all < tt > x < /tt > and < tt > y < /tt > . ( This implies that < tt > x.compareTo ( y ) < /tt > must throw an exception iff < tt > y.compareTo ( x ) < /tt > throws an exception . ) < p/ > < p > The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive : < tt > ( x.compareTo ( y ) & gt ; 0 & amp ; & amp ; y.compareTo ( z ) & gt ; 0 ) < /tt > implies < tt > x.compareTo ( z ) & gt ; 0 < /tt > . < p/ > < p > Finally , the implementor must ensure that < tt > x.compareTo ( y ) ==0 < /tt > implies that < tt > sgn ( x.compareTo ( z ) ) == sgn ( y.compareTo ( z ) ) < /tt > , for all < tt > z < /tt > . < p/ > < p > It is strongly recommended , but < i > not < /i > strictly required that < tt > ( x.compareTo ( y ) ==0 ) == ( x.equals ( y ) ) < /tt > . Generally speaking , any class that implements the < tt > Comparable < /tt > interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact . The recommended language is `` Note : this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals . '' < p/ > < p > In the foregoing description , the notation < tt > sgn ( < /tt > < i > expression < /i > < tt > ) < /tt > designates the mathematical < i > signum < /i > function , which is defined to return one of < tt > -1 < /tt > , < tt > 0 < /tt > , or < tt > 1 < /tt > according to whether the value of < i > expression < /i > is negative , zero or positive .
12778	Moves to the next record , which in this case means moving the index to the next record satisfying the selection constant , and returning false if there are no more such index records . If there is a next record , the method moves the tablescan to the corresponding data record .

12842	returns the class loader object for this class . it is almost impossible to distinguish the dynamic class loader for classes . a conservative way is to use one static representation for all class loader , which means all class loader variable aliased together . private native java.lang.ClassLoader getClassLoader0 ( ) ;
12847	Login with com.facebook.login.LoginManager The reason why this method returns a MayBe is that when a user cancel the operation , it does not emit any value neither an error . Maybe have a onComplete method that is covering this case . Use onSuccess to handle a success result . Use onComplete to handle canceled operation .
12853	Set the Sounds to be played when a Pull Event happens . You specify which sound plays for which events by calling this method multiple times for each event . < p/ > If you 've already set a sound for a certain event , and add another sound for that event , only the new sound will be played .

12889	Gets whether the node is frequently listening . Frequently listening is responding to a beam signal . Apart from increased latency , nothing else is noticeable from the serial api side .
12892	Return an Flowable that re-emits the emissions from the source Flowable , and then re-subscribes to the source long as a condition is true . < p > < img width= '' 640 '' src= '' https : //raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/doWhile.png '' alt= '' '' >
12907	Specify a custom content type for requesting media from the gallery . < p > For images use : `` images/ & # 42 ; '' < /p > < p > Default : `` & # 42 ; / & # 42 ; '' < /p >
12942	Returns a float in the range from 0.0f to 1.0f , possibly inclusive of 0.0f and 1.0f themselves .

An image pushed to a V1 registry without namespace prefix is processed in the following way : < registry_name > / < repository_name > - > < registry_name > /library/ < repository_name > Results from V1 queries , however , do not contain the default prefix . This could be a problem later when we instantiate containers based on these images . An image pushed to a V2 registry does not get the default prefix .
12953	IntelliJ inserts an identifier string at the caret position during code completion. < br > We 're only interested in the portion of the string before the caret , so trim the rest .
12958	Reset this visualization , clearing out all visualization tuples . All data sets added using the `` addXXX '' methods will be removed from the visualization . All registered focus groups added using the addFocusGroup ( ) methods will be retained , but will be cleared of all tuples .

13060	Reads a byte array from the bytes message stream . < P > If the length of array < code > value < /code > is less than the number of bytes remaining to be read from the stream , the array should be filled . A subsequent call reads the next increment , and so on . < P > If the number of bytes remaining in the stream is less than the length of array < code > value < /code > , the bytes should be read into the array . The return value of the total number of bytes read will be less than the length of the array , indicating that there are no more bytes left to be read from the stream . The next read of the stream returns -1 .
13096	Appends a new member to the end of this object , with the specified name and the JSON representation of the specified < code > float < /code > value . < p > This method < strong > does not prevent duplicate names < /strong > . Calling this method with a name that already exists in the object will append another member with the same name . In order to replace existing members , use the method < code > set ( name , value ) < /code > instead . However , < strong > < em > add < /em > is much faster than < em > set < /em > < /strong > ( because it does not need to search for existing members ) . Therefore < em > add < /em > should be preferred when constructing new objects . < /p >
13105	Creates a MapContext object that has the same Map objects on its stack , but with a new Map pushed on the top ; meant to be used to enable a situation where a parent and child context are operating simultaneously using two different MapContext objects , but sharing the Maps in common

To perform a 1-sided test , use < code > alpha * 2 < /code > < /p > < p > < strong > Usage Note : < /strong > < br > The validity of the test depends on the assumptions of the parametric t-test procedure , as discussed < a href= '' http : //www.basic.nwu.edu/statguidefiles/ttest_unpaired_ass_viol.html '' > here < /a > < /p > < p > < strong > Preconditions < /strong > : < ul > < li > The input array lengths must be the same and their common length must be at least 2 . < /li > < li > < code > 0 & lt ; alpha & lt ; 0.5 < /code > < /li > < /ul > < /p >
13144	Ensures that the receiver can hold at least the specified number of associations without needing to allocate new internal memory . If necessary , allocates new internal memory and increases the capacity of the receiver . < p > This method never need be called ; it is for performance tuning only . Calling this method before < tt > put ( ) < /tt > ing a large number of associations boosts performance , because the receiver will grow only once instead of potentially many times and hash collisions get less probable .

13229	Replaces the state of all targets in the XLIFF . Note that the regex acutally replaces the state without looking at the target for context so this assumes the state attribute is not used in another context ( which should be fine for xliff standard , if not the regex should be made more specific )
13232	Only used for serialization . The persist method is invoked before the serialization of the object . This allows the object to prepare in some implementation specific way for the serialization process .
13238	Add the id of an associated model into self model 's association collection . The associated model does n't have a foreign key column in the corresponding table . Instead self model has a foreign key column in the corresponding table .

13493	Returns the adapter position of the last fully visible view . < p > Note that bounds check is only performed in the current orientation . That means , if LayoutManager is horizontal , it will only check the view 's left and right edges .
13508	Transform to context-insensitive result -- Transform to context-insensitive result . If you stick to working with SPARK , you can use this option to transform the context sensitive result to insensitive result . After the transformation , the context sensitive points-to quries can not be answered .

13741	Back up one character . This provides a sort of lookahead capability , so that you can test for a digit or letter before attempting to parse the next number or identifier .
13745	Merge String Buffer -- Represent all StringBuffers as one object . When this option is set to true , all allocation sites creating java.lang.StringBuffer objects are grouped together as a single allocation site . Allocation sites creating a java.lang.StringBuilder object are also grouped together as a single allocation site .
13753	Field Based -- Use a field-based rather than field-sensitive representation . When this option is set to true , fields are represented by variable ( Green ) nodes , and the object that the field belongs to is ignored ( all objects are lumped together ) , giving a field-based analysis . Otherwise , fields are represented by field reference ( Red ) nodes , and the objects that they belong to are distinguished , giving a field-sensitive analysis .
13761	Finds the implementation Class object in the specified order . The specified order is the following : < ol > < li > query the system property using < code > System.getProperty < /code > < li > read < code > META-INF/services/ < i > factoryId < /i > < /code > file < li > use fallback classname < /ol >

13765	Close a cursor handle . < p > The cursor handle will be freed and must not be used again after this call . Its transaction must still be live if it is a write-transaction .
13789	Returns a variable pointing to a string constant I am not sure if repeated calls of methods in this class will return the same object or not . A conservative approach would say YES , for definitely points-to , but NO for may points-to . We should avoid analyzing these unsafe native methods . native java.lang.String getLocalHostName ( ) throws java.net.UnknownHostException ;
13793	Replace one or more String values in the specified column with new values . < p > Keys in the map are the original values ; the Values in the map are their replacements . If a String appears in the data but does not appear in the provided map ( as a key ) , that String values will not be modified .
13798	Appends a dynamic parameter value . < ul > < li > It does n't expect any template parameters within the parameter value. < /li > < li > The parameter value is appended to the previous parameter value. < /li > < /ul >
13808	This controls the action to take with the item the player is holding . This includes both blocks and items ( such as flint and steel or records ) . When this is set to default , it will be allowed if no action is taken on the interacted block .

13831	This method is automatically called by the webDriver . It should not be called manually by the user . It resets the stack frame when the web driver is closed .
13842	By default LookupIncludeBehavior.ALWAYS is in place and we let the relationship repositories load the relations . There is no need to do join fetches , which can lead to problems with paging ( evaluated in memory instead of the db ) .
13843	Copy chars from a < code > Reader < /code > to a < code > Writer < /code > . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > . < p > Large streams ( over 2GB ) will return a chars copied value of < code > -1 < /code > after the copy has completed since the correct number of chars can not be returned as an int . For large streams use the < code > copyLarge ( Reader , Writer ) < /code > method .
13853	Register the given content type to use the given class name as its kit When this is called , an entry is added into the private HashMap of the registered editors kits . This is needed so that the SyntaxPane library has it 's own registration of all the EditorKits
13859	Fabricates a non-unique UUID value for the specified timestamp . Do NOT use this as a unique identifier . It 's only useful for performing range comparisons using a TimeUUID-aware comparator .
13863	If the user navigates away , this is the furthest point in the lifecycle this Fragment gets to . Here , the view hierarchy returned from onCreateView ( ) is destroyed -- the Fragment itself is NOT destroyed . If the user navigates back to this tab , this Fragment goes through its lifecycle beginning from onCreateView ( ) . < p/ > TODO : Verify that members are not reset .
13866	Ignore Types Entirely -- Make Paddle completely ignore declared types of variables . When this option is set to true , all parts of Paddle completely ignore declared types of variables and casts .
13875	Whether markers animate their zoom with the zoom animation , if disabled they will disappear for the length of the animation . By default it 's enabled in all browsers that support CSS3 Transitions except Android . default true
13916	3.8.6 Effective Total Range ( all and sequence ) and Effective Total Range ( choice ) The following methods are used to return min/max range for a particle . They are not exactly the same as it 's described in the spec , but all the values from the spec are retrievable by these methods .
13936	Construct a RecipientEntry from just an address that has been entered with both an associated display name . This address has not been resolved to a contact and therefore does not have a contact id or photo .
13948	Returns an iterator over the elements in this applyTransformToDestination . The elements are returned in no particular order ( unless this applyTransformToDestination is an instance of some class that provides a guarantee ) .
13973	With Field References -- . The analysis treats field references ( static and instance ) as common subexpressions ; however , we are more conservative when writing to a field , because the base of the field reference may be aliased . We also assume that the application is single-threaded or that the field references occur in a synchronized block . That is , we assume that a field may not be changed by other threads between two field references .
13977	Indicates if this renderer uses a closed or open path . If true , the renderer will draw closed polygons , if false , the renderer will draw poly-lines or poly-curves .
13978	You are currently at Phase 4 Restriction State and will be downgraded to Phase 3 in % 0 minutes . You can not acquire any loot , XP , Kinah , or Abyss Points , and are unable to gather or extract any items . You are also banned from joining a Group or Alliance .

14010	IDs separated with a comma , that are IDs of users who posted photos and IDs of photos themselves with an underscore character between such IDs . To get information about a photo in the group album , you shall specify group ID instead of user ID . Example : 1_129207899,6492_135055734 , -20629724_271945303
14037	By default , the initial load process will chunk large tables and will iterate over the table ( entity ) per chunk ( concurrently ) . This setting allows to control the chunk size to split the table by . By default , set to < code > 100,000 < /code > . Batching can be disabled by setting < code > -1 < /code > .
14063	Set a Map of field name/values to be ANDed together as the WHERE clause for the query NOTE : Each successive call to any of the where ( ... ) methods will replace the currently set condition for the query .
14081	Base64-encodes the specified username and password for Basic Authorization for HTTP requests or upstream proxy authorization . The format of Basic auth is `` username : password '' as a base64 string .
14094	Verbose -- Print warnings about where the call graph may be incomplete . Due to the effects of native methods and reflection , it may not always be possible to construct a fully conservative call graph . Setting this option to true causes Soot to point out the parts of the call graph that may be incomplete , so that they can be checked by hand .
14105	Shows a dialog used to accept input for applying a force to a body at a specified point . < p > Returns null if the dialog is closed or canceled .
14112	Unexports the remote objects that were previously exported via this exporter . The < code > unexport < /code > method of the main exporter is called with the specified argument and if that returns < code > true < /code > , the < code > unexport < /code > method of the bootstrap exporter is called with < code > true < /code > . The result of the main < code > unexport < /code > call is returned by this method . Any exception thrown by either < code > unexport < /code > call is rethrown by this method .
14113	< p > Generates a stream that is computed from a provided stream following two steps. < /p > < p > The first steps maps this stream to an < code > DoubleStream < /code > that is then rolled following the same principle as the < code > roll ( ) < /code > method . This steps builds a < code > Stream & lt ; DoubleStream & gt ; < /code > . < /p > < p > Then the < code > average ( ) < /code > method is called on each < code > DoubleStream < /code > using a mapper , and a < code > DoubleStream < /code > of averages is returned. < /p > < p > The resulting stream has the same number of elements as the provided stream , minus the size of the window width , to preserve consistency of each collection . < /p > < p > A < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown if the provided stream or the mapper is null. < /p >
14118	Get the contents of a < code > Reader < /code > as a < code > byte [ ] < /code > using the specified character encoding . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > .

14159	Puts the named value in the environment . Supports the `` . '' ( dot ) syntax to access Map members and the `` [ ] '' ( bracket ) syntax to access List entries . If the brackets for a list are empty the value will be appended to end of the list , otherwise the value will be set in the position of the number in the brackets . If a `` + '' ( plus sign ) is included inside the square brackets before the index number the value will inserted/added at that index instead of set at that index . This value is expanded , supporting the insertion of other environment values using the `` $ { } '' notation .
14160	< code > mergeLocal < /code > combines this sphere with a second bounding sphere locally . Altering this sphere to contain both the original and the additional sphere volumes ;
14164	Return < code > true < /code > if the supplied < code > Collection < /code > is null or empty . Otherwise , return < code > false < /code > .

14212	Reads the entire input from the given reader and parses it as JSON . The input must contain a valid JSON value , optionally padded with whitespace . < p > Characters are read in chunks into an input buffer . Hence , wrapping a reader in an additional < code > BufferedReader < /code > likely wo n't improve reading performance . < /p >
14227	Given an index in the range < code > 0 ... size ( ) -1 < /code > , returns the value from the < code > index < /code > th key-value mapping that this SparseArray stores .
14228	Configures Gson to apply the passed in exclusion strategy during serialization . If this method is invoked numerous times with different exclusion strategy objects then the exclusion strategies that were added will be applied as a disjunction rule . This means that if one of the added exclusion strategies suggests that a field ( or class ) should be skipped then that field ( or object ) is skipped during its serialization .
14232	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to the specified < code > File < /code > line by line , optionally appending . The specified character encoding and the default line ending will be used .
14257	Returns a human-readable version of the file size , where the input represents a specific number of bytes . < p > If the size is over 1GB , the size is returned as the number of whole GB , i.e . the size is rounded down to the nearest GB boundary . < /p > < p > Similarly for the 1MB and 1KB boundaries . < /p >
14258	Returns true if a method call is fixed , i.e. , assuming that all classes in the Scene resemble library code , then client code can not possible overwrite the called method . This is trivially true for InvokeStatic and InvokeSpecial , but can also hold for virtual invokes if all possible call targets in the library can not be overwritten .
14272	Force a Namespace to be declared on the root element . < p > < p > By default , the XMLWriter will declare only the Namespaces needed for an element ; as a result , a Namespace may be declared many places in a document if it is not used on the root element . < /p > < p > < p > This method forces a Namespace to be declared on the root element even if it is not used there , and reduces the number of xmlns attributes in the document . < /p >
14300	Write an IFallback object to the short-term log DB table . It relies on the fallback mechanism for those cases in which the DB becomes unavailable . If there is data temporarily stored in the fallback file it will start a new thread which will independently deal with the task of reading back the data from the file to the DB .
14308	Connect the client to the server . This is a blocking call , so the calling thread will be blocked until the operation succeeded or failed . < p > Note : Blocking API call without specifying a timeout , in very rare cases , can block the calling thread indefinitely , if the server response is not received or lost . Use the alternative APIs with timeout for applications that expect responses within fixed duration . < /p >
14315	Insert Null Checks -- . Insert , before the inlined body of the target method , a check that throws a NullPointerException if the receiver object is null . This ensures that inlining will not eliminate exceptions which would have occurred in its absence .

14360	Splits the given string using the given regex as delimiters . This method is the same as the String.split ( ) method ( except it throws the results in a List ) , and is included just to give a call that is parallel to the other static regex methods in this class .
14368	Calculates the scaled , two-sided `` Z-value '' for a given confidence level and the default number of decision points . For a normal distribution , the Z-value is the number of standard deviations from the mean corresponding to the given confidence level . A two-sided value distributes the confidence region equally around the mean of the distribution . The Z-value is scaled in order to account for multiple decision points throughout the experiment .
14375	Fetch the buffer which holds a read-only view of the LMDI allocated memory . Any use of this buffer must comply with the standard LMDB C `` mdb_get '' contract ( ie do not modify , do not attempt to release the memory , do not use once the transaction or cursor closes , do not use after a write etc ) .
14377	Return < tt > true < /tt > if the integer argument includes the < tt > NO_RETURN_VALUE < /tt > modifier , < tt > false < /tt > otherwise .
14379	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a list of Strings , one entry per line , using the specified character encoding . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .

14566	Returns a new TrustSource containing the same trusted CAs as this TrustSource , plus zero or more additional trusted X509Certificates . If trustedCertificates is null or empty , returns this same TrustSource .
14574	Use this method very carefully . It can easily lead to a deadlock . executes the transactional command in a separate thread . Using a separate thread creates a brand new transactional context and therefore this transaction will not join the context of any outer transactions . For example , if the outer transaction rolls back , this command will not . Calling this method will lead to deadlock if the outer transaction has locked any object that will be accessed in this transaction . It can also lead to deadlock if the same table is accessed in the outer transaction as this command . It can also lead to a deadlock if the connection pool is tied up in the outer transaction and has nothing left for this command .
14602	For management purposes . Updates the supervision timestamp of all Processes and ( Sub ) Equipments , notifying all listeners of the change ( republishing supervision events also and re-evaluating all alarms ) ; takes some minutes to refresh all alarms .
14620	Instead of evaluating all parameters immediately , invoke the request to run later . This option allows us to avoid the situation where a value has just changed , is forcefully re-evaluated immediately , and causes Swing to throw an exception between we 're editing a value while it 's in a locked read-only state .

14646	SCIPIO : Makes an escaped Freemarker string value without enclosing single-quotes , as intended for a regular ( non-raw ) string . < p > Trivial implementation for non-String types ( Integer , Boolean , ... ) , which get returned as strings . Must be non-null .
14651	Unsubscribes to a given topic . This is a blocking call , so the calling thread is blocked until the unsubscribe operation completed or failed . < p > Note : Blocking API call without specifying a timeout , in very rare cases , can block the calling thread indefinitely , if the server response is not received or lost . Use the alternative APIs with timeout for applications that expect responses within fixed duration . < /p >
14652	Manipulates the map once available . This callback is triggered when the map is ready to be used . This is where we can add markers or lines , add listeners or move the camera . In this case , we just add a marker near Sydney , Australia . If Google Play services is not installed on the device , the user will be prompted to install it inside the SupportMapFragment . This method will only be triggered once the user has installed Google Play services and returned to the app .

14799	Hook for redirecting requests . Applies to WebView requests as well as requests made by plugins . To handle the request directly , return a URI in the form : cdvplugin : //pluginId/ ... And implement handleOpenForRead ( ) . To make this easier , use the toPluginUri ( ) and fromPluginUri ( ) helpers : public Uri remapUri ( Uri uri ) { return toPluginUri ( uri ) ; } public CordovaResourceApi.OpenForReadResult handleOpenForRead ( Uri uri ) throws IOException { Uri origUri = fromPluginUri ( uri ) ; ... }
14816	Computes a < a href= '' http : //www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc22.htm # formula '' > t statistic < /a > given observed values and a comparison constant . < p > This statistic can be used to perform a one sample t-test for the mean . < /p > < p > < strong > Preconditions < /strong > : < ul > < li > The observed array length must be at least 2 . < /li > < /ul > < /p >

Syntax such as < code > file : ///my % 20docs/file.txt < /code > will be correctly decoded to < code > /my docs/file.txt < /code > . Starting with version 1.5 , this method uses UTF-8 to decode percent-encoded octets to characters . Additionally , malformed percent-encoded octets are handled leniently by passing them through literally .

15060	Returns the number of elements in this stack . < p > Beware that , unlike in most collections , this method is < em > NOT < /em > a constant-time operation . Because of the asynchronous nature of these stacks , determining the current number of elements requires an O ( n ) traversal . Additionally , if elements are added or removed during execution of this method , the returned result may be inaccurate . Thus , this method is typically not very useful in concurrent applications .
15063	Returns true if there are more bases at which the locus iterator must emit LocusInfos because there are loci beyond the last emitted loci which are in the set of loci to be emitted and the iterator is setup to emit uncovered loci - so we can guarantee we 'll emit those loci .

15181	Check whether a RecordID is valid or not . That is , check to see if the slot in the page specified by the RecordID contains a valid record ( i.e . whether the bit in the slot bitmap is set to 1 ) .
15187	Check if lock is held . If not , error out and do not reacquire . Use this in cases where there are many waiters by default and reacquire is unlikley to succeed .
15197	The dependent loader logic goes like this : < p/ > 1 . In cursor thread put items in stripes on queue and increment the counter . 2 . In cursor thread finish cursor , decrement count by one completed task and signal that task completed . 3 . In consumer thread pick up stripes from the queue , check if items are not duplicates with FullUniqueIndex and add them to index if necessary 4 . Increment count by number of added items 5 . Decrement count by number of items removed from the stripe . < p/ > The problem happens when # 2 is the end of the last scheduled task . At this point we fire notify . The count is still positive because we added something to the stripes . After this we pick items from the stripes and check on the FullUniqueIndex , but coincidentally the index already has all the elements and these are duplicates . So we add 0 at # 4 and deduct all items from the stripe at # 5 . The count=0 but we do not have any tasks to execute and nobody will notify the engine to get out of wait .
15200	Dump Answer -- Dump computed reaching types for comparison with other solvers . When this option is set to true , the computed reaching types for each variable are dumped to a file , so that they can be compared with the results of other analyses ( such as the old VTA ) .

15324	Create the InvocationConstraints with connection absolute time based on an increasing retry . When all retries are exhausted , return the InvocationConstraints.EMPTY . InvocationConstraints.EMPTY is interpreted as an infinite timeout . The connection will then block until established or an error occurs .
15328	Concatenate additional characters onto the end of the data stored in this node . Note that this , and insert ( ) , are the paths by which a DOM could wind up accumulating more data than the language 's strings can easily handle . ( See above discussion . )
15346	Given an input class object , return a string which consists of the class 's package name as a pathname , i.e. , all dots ( ' . ' ) are replaced by slashes ( '/ ' ) . Neither a leading nor trailing slash is added . The result could be concatenated with a slash and the name of a resource , and fed directly to ClassLoader.getResource ( ) . For it to be fed to Class.getResource , a leading slash would also have to be prepended to the return value .

If this map contains more than < tt > Integer.MAX_VALUE < /tt > elements , it returns < tt > Integer.MAX_VALUE < /tt > . < p > Beware that , unlike in most collections , this method is < em > NOT < /em > a constant-time operation . Because of the asynchronous nature of these maps , determining the current number of elements requires traversing them all to count them . Additionally , it is possible for the size to change during execution of this method , in which case the returned result will be inaccurate . Thus , this method is typically not very useful in concurrent applications .
15518	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to an < code > OutputStream < /code > line by line , using the default character encoding of the platform and the specified line ending .
15529	Notifies current context that new section is being parsed . E.g . when < code > 'dependencies { ... } ' < /code > is about to be parsed , this method is called with < code > 'dependencies ' < /code > argument .

15676	Get the standard deviation of a tuple data value . If any tuple does not have the named field or the field is not a numeric data type , NaN will be returned .
15700	Notify the host application that a page has started loading . This method is called once for each main frame load so a page with iframes or framesets will call onPageStarted one time for the main frame . This also means that onPageStarted will not be called when the contents of an embedded frame changes , i.e . clicking a link whose target is an iframe , it will also not be called for fragment navigations ( navigations to # fragment_id ) .
15756	Populates a cell union with the given S2CellIds or 64-bit cells ids , and then calls Normalize ( ) . The InitSwap ( ) version takes ownership of the vector data without copying and clears the given vector . These methods may be called multiple times .
15757	Adds a component to the parser configuration . This method will also add all of the component 's recognized features and properties to the list of default recognized features and properties .
15782	Directly restrict a flag for an ID , this will take priority over the default permission and will override the previous direct permission . The current default denial message will be used , if the default message changes later it will not update .

15879	Creates a Gson Builder that converts by default a time stamp to a long value . Furthermore , in case of an < code > Object < /code > field it does not try to deserialize the object but stores instead the Json String to that field . The deserialization has then to be handled in an extra step once the final Object class information is available .
15885	Creates a file Uri for a file defined by its absolute path . The method can handle the case of an absolute path ( e.g . /data/data ... . ) and a Uri path containing the file : // scheme ( e.g . file : ///data/data ... )

Side channel auth may take the form of Bouncer-based framework authentication or potentially other methods in the future ( eg Kerberos ) . Broken out into a separate function to allow easy customization in tests .
15967	With this option the template rendering will not create files , but all templates are executed and all input files are checked . Use this option to find errors and warnings without modifying the project into a state where it may not compile . Default : false
15998	Adjust bottom edge by current crop window width and the given aspect ratio , the top edge remains in possition while the top adjusts to keep aspect ratio to the width .
15999	This method generates one of two possible Executor requirements .

16873	Establishes a connection to the service . Call this method once the callback passed here is ready to handle calls . If you pass in an GSA context , it will be sent up the service as soon as the connection is established .
16876	Main working method . You may be surprised that here , just 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' is called . But internally , it works like this : AudioSystem.write ( ) contains a loop that is trying to read from the passed AudioInputStream . Since we have a special AudioInputStream that gets its data from a TargetDataLine , reading from the AudioInputStream leads to reading from the TargetDataLine . The data read this way is then written to the passed File . Before writing of audio data starts , a header is written according to the desired audio file type . Reading continues untill no more data can be read from the AudioInputStream . In our case , this happens if no more data can be read from the TargetDataLine . This , in turn , happens if the TargetDataLine is stopped or closed ( which implies stopping ) . ( Also see the comment above . ) Then , the file is closed and 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' returns .
16886	Guarding strategy -- Describes how to guard the program from unsound assumptions.. Using a reflection log is only sound for method executions that were logged . Executing the program differently may be unsound . Soot can insert guards at program points for which the reflection log contains no information . When these points are reached ( because the program is executed differently ) then the follwing will happen , depending on the value of this flag . ignore : no guard is inserted , the program executes normally but under unsound assumptions . print : the program prints a stack trace when reaching a porgram location that was not traced but continues to run . throw ( default ) : the program throws an Error instead .
16887	Terminates an open connection . Calling < code > abort < /code > results in : < ul > < li > The connection marked as closed < li > Closes any physical connection to the database < li > Releases resources used by the connection < li > Insures that any thread that is currently accessing the connection will either progress to completion or throw an < code > SQLException < /code > . < /ul > < p/ > Calling < code > abort < /code > marks the connection closed and releases any resources . Calling < code > abort < /code > on a closed connection is a no-op . < p/ > It is possible that the aborting and releasing of the resources that are held by the connection can take an extended period of time . When the < code > abort < /code > method returns , the connection will have been marked as closed and the < code > Executor < /code > that was passed as a parameter to abort may still be executing tasks to release resources . < p/ > This method checks to see that there is an < code > SQLPermission < /code > object before allowing the method to proceed . If a < code > SecurityManager < /code > exists and its < code > checkPermission < /code > method denies calling < code > abort < /code > , this method throws a < code > java.lang.SecurityException < /code > .
16889	Implements the same behaviour as the `` touch '' utility on Unix . It creates a new file with size 0 or , if the file exists already , it is opened and closed without modifying it , but updating the file date and time . < p/ > NOTE : As from v1.3 , this method throws an IOException if the last modified date of the file can not be set . Also , as from v1.3 this method creates parent directories if they do not exist .
16897	Reads the next byte of data from the audio input stream . The audio input stream 's frame size must be one byte , or an < code > IOException < /code > will be thrown .
16911	Checks if the element we 're searching for is represented by a file or directory. < br > e.g . a java class PSI element , or an actual PsiFile element .
16919	Checks if the element is an & lt ; fallback & gt ; element . The element must have the XInclude namespace , and a local name of `` fallback '' .

17010	Determines if this activity already has retained fragment that stores instances attached , and if no , attaches it . Call this method as early as possible . Take note that this method also calls executePendingTransactions ( ) , and that 's why it 's better to perform all fragment manipulations after this method have been called .
17012	Notifies of the presence of a TextDecl line in an entity . If present , this method will be called immediately following the startParameterEntity call . < p/ > < strong > Note : < /strong > This method is only called for external parameter entities referenced in the DTD .
17013	The open interface for other classes in CRUD package to save a model . It is called when a model class calls the save method . This method will only save the baseObj into database without analyzing any association , so that the saving process will be faster .
17016	Return an Iterator over the set of keys and values that have been added . Using the entry set to iterate is more efficient in the case where you need to access respective counts as well as values , since it does n't require a `` get '' for every key ... the value is provided in the Map.Entry .
17017	If the given protection domain is the protection domain of this class , then < code > true < /code > is returned . Otherwise , delegates to the < code > implies < /code > method of the currently active sub-policy to determine if the given permission is implied by the permissions for the specified protection domain .

17124	Send a message to a remote device . If the local device did't connected to the remote devices , it will call connectDevice ( ) , then send the message . You can obtain a response from the remote device , just as http . However , it will blocked if did n't get response from the remote device .
17168	Publishes the payload to a given topic . This is a blocking call so the calling thread is blocked until the publish operation succeeded , failed , or the specified timeout has elapsed .
17185	A processing instruction . Processing instructions consist of a target name and , optionally , text data . The data is only meaningful to the application . < p/ > Typically , a processing instruction 's data will contain a series of pseudo-attributes . These pseudo-attributes follow the form of element attributes but are < strong > not < /strong > parsed or presented to the application as anything other than text . The application is responsible for parsing the data .
17213	Get the optional double value associated with an index . The defaultValue is returned if there is no value for the index , or if the value is not a number and can not be converted to a number .
17227	Checks whether two filenames are equal using the case rules of the system . < p > No processing is performed on the filenames other than comparison . The check is case-sensitive on Unix and case-insensitive on Windows .
17231	Topological Sort -- Sort variable nodes in dump . When this option is set to true , the representation dumped by the Dump PAG option is dumped with the variable ( green ) nodes in ( pseudo- ) topological order . This option has no effect unless Dump PAG is true .
17249	Return < tt > true < /tt > if the integer argument includes the < tt > NOTIFY_UNMATCHED < /tt > modifier , < tt > false < /tt > otherwise .
17251	Reports an error that occured while scanning . In a wellformed scanner ( no or only correct usage of yypushback ( int ) and a match-all fallback rule ) this method will only be called with things that `` Ca n't Possibly Happen '' . If this method is called , something is seriously wrong ( e.g . a JFlex bug producing a faulty scanner etc. ) . Usual syntax/scanner level error handling should be done in error fallback rules .
17255	If a table exists but is empty then it will not be stashed . This method will surface this exception only if the table exists . Otherwise it converts it to an UnknownTableException .
17271	Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map These mappings will replace any mappings that this map had for any of the keys currently in the specified map .
17272	Return a new plain object that is the result of merging this plain object with the supplied plain object . Any property in this object that has the same name in toMerge will be replaced with toMerge 's value e.g { a:1 , b:1 } .merge ( { b:2 , c:3 } ) would result in { a:1 , b:2 , c:3 }
17277	Convert a well-formed ( but not necessarily valid ) XML string into a JSONArray using the JsonML transform . Each XML tag is represented as a JSONArray in which the first element is the tag name . If the tag has attributes , then the second element will be JSONObject containing the name/value pairs . If the tag contains children , then strings and JSONArrays will represent the child content and tags . Comments , prologs , DTDs , and < code > & lt ; [ [ ] ] > < /code > are ignored .
17284	Checks whether the new abstraction is the direct successor of the original abstraction given to the flow function . If not , the chain of abstractions is compacted to length 1 .

17350	Return a rectangle that contains all points whose latitude distance from this rectangle is at most margin.lat ( ) , and whose longitude distance from this rectangle is at most margin.lng ( ) . In particular , latitudes are clamped while longitudes are wrapped . Note that any expansion of an empty interval remains empty , and both components of the given margin must be non-negative . NOTE : If you are trying to grow a rectangle by a certain *distance* on the sphere ( e.g . 5km ) , use the ConvolveWithCap ( ) method instead .
17352	DOM Level 3 WD - Experimental . If the document is currently being loaded as a result of the method < code > load < /code > being invoked the loading and parsing is immediately aborted . The possibly partial result of parsing the document is discarded and the document is cleared .
17356	Private method to notify all registered < code > DataTagUpdateListener < /code > instances . Please avoid calling this method within a WRITELOCK block since it could be a potential candidate for risking a deadlocks .
17358	< code > addLocal < /code > adds a provided vector to this vector internally , and returns a handle to this vector for easy chaining of calls . If the provided vector is null , null is returned .
17370	IDs of topics to be returned ( 100 maximum ) . By default , all topics are returned . < p > If this parameter is set , the `` order '' , `` offset '' , and `` count '' parameters are ignored .

17388	Finds r such that a = q b + r with 0 < = r < b if b > 0 and b < r < = 0 if b < 0 . < p > This methods returns the same value as integer modulo when a and b are same signs , but returns a different value when they are opposite ( i.e . q is negative ) . < /p >
17390	Returns < code > true < /code > if the filter should be active when the space is in backup mode . Default to < code > true < /code > .
17403	Register a rich text editor . < p > Before using the editor it needs to be registered to an RTManager . Using means any calls to the editor ( setText will fail if the editor is n't registered ) ! MUST be called from the ui thread .
17404	Called when the Activity is being destroyed ( e.g . if a plugin calls out to an external Activity and the OS kills the CordovaActivity in the background ) . The plugin should save its state in this method only if it is awaiting the result of an external Activity and needs to preserve some information so as to handle that result ; onRestoreStateForActivityResult ( ) will only be called if the plugin is the recipient of an Activity result
17406	Remove all local bindings ( except ret ) . This info is indeed superfluous on summary purity graphs representing the effect of a method . This saves a little memory , but also , simplify summary graph drawings a lot ! DO NOT USE DURING INTRA-PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS !

17437	Returns < code > true < /code > if the given permission is a < code > GrantPermission < /code > implied by this permission , or < code > false < /code > otherwise . Implication is defined as follows : for a given < code > GrantPermission g < /code > , let < code > c ( g ) < /code > denote the set of all permissions contained within < code > g < /code > or within arbitrarily nested < code > GrantPermission < /code > s inside < code > g < /code > , excluding nested < code > GrantPermission < /code > s themselves . Then , a < code > GrantPermission g1 < /code > is implied by another < code > GrantPermission g2 < /code > if and only if each permission in < code > c ( g1 ) < /code > is implied by < code > c ( g2 ) < /code > . < p > Implication of contained < code > java.security.UnresolvedPermission < /code > s is special-cased : an < code > UnresolvedPermission p1 < /code > is taken to imply another < code > UnresolvedPermission p2 < /code > if and only if the serialized representations of < code > p1 < /code > and < code > p2 < /code > are identical .
17438	Set the EntityCondition to be used as the WHERE clause for the query NOTE : Each successive call to any of the where ( ... ) methods will replace the currently set condition for the query .
17443	Sets up a circular chain of pointers to the records in the page . There is an integer added to the end of each log record whose value is the offset of the previous log record . The first four bytes of the page contain an integer whose value is the offset of the integer for the last log record in the page .
17476	Ignore wrong static-ness -- Ignores errors due to wrong staticness . Some projects have been shown to contain invalid bytecode that tries to access a static field or method in a non-static way or the other way around . The VM 's bytecode verifier will reject such bytecode when loaded into the VM . This option , when enabled , causes to create Jimple bodies in such cases nontheless , ignoring the error .
17483	Overrides < tt > ObjectOutputStream < /tt > 's method with no-op functionality . This prevents header information from being sent to the stream , which makes appending to existing log files easier . Otherwise , appending header info to an existing log file would cause a corresponding < code > ObjectInputStream < /code > to throw a < code > StreamCorruptedException < /code > when it encountered the header information instead of the class/object type code information it was expecting .
17488	Force a Namespace to be declared on the root element . < p > < p > By default , the XMLWriter will declare only the Namespaces needed for an element ; as a result , a Namespace may be declared many places in a document if it is not used on the root element . < /p > < p > < p > This method forces a Namespace to be declared on the root element even if it is not used there , and reduces the number of xmlns attributes in the document . < /p >
17489	Publishes the raw payload to a given topic . This is a blocking call so the calling thread is blocked until the publish operation is succeeded or failed . < p > Note : Blocking API call without specifying a timeout , in very rare cases , can block the calling thread indefinitely , if the server response is not received or lost . Use the alternative APIs with timeout for applications that expect responses within fixed duration . < /p >

17612	Perform this module 's processing on abstract `` MaryData '' input < code > d < /code > . Subclasses need to make sure that the < code > process ( ) < /code > method is thread-safe , because in server-mode , it will be called from different threads at the same time . A sensible way to do this seems to be not to use any global or static variables , or to use them read-only . < p/ >
17622	Return the complement of the interior of the interval . An interval and its complement have the same boundary but do not share any interior values . The complement operator is not a bijection , since the complement of a singleton interval ( containing a single value ) is the same as the complement of an empty interval .
17633	Validate scheme . If schemes [ ] was initialized to a non null , then only those schemes are allowed . Otherwise the default schemes are `` http '' , `` https '' , `` ftp '' . Matching is case-blind .
17634	Returns true if the current element is a top level included item . This means it 's either the child of a fallback element , or the top level item in an included document
17642	Enables the line to be drawn in dashed mode , e.g . like this `` - - - - - - '' . THIS ONLY WORKS IF HARDWARE-ACCELERATION IS TURNED OFF . Keep in mind that hardware acceleration boosts performance .

17730	Checks if the service is ready to use , waiting if it is initializing , and throwing < code > NoSuchObjectException < /code > if it is shutting down . Note that the < code > NoSuchObjectException < /code > will be wrapped in a < code > RemoteExceptionWrapper < /code > .
17732	Reset the counter in a non atomic fashion , at a quiscient state this method will reset the counter to its initial value , but in a concurrent state , interleaving operations affect is not deterministic and may be overridden or accumulated . A normal use would be a reset of statistic counter that the precise accumulation of statistics is not mandatory .
17781	Starts the process of shutting down this node . It is assumed that this method should return within 30 seconds , at which point the server should be ready to disconnect from the distributed cache ( in the case of a distributed setup ) . < p > Only the first call to this method will have an effect . Subsequent calls are ignored . Uses Spring 's lifecycle management .
17792	Automatically called by Guice during injection of any object . Checks if the injected object 's type is annotated as PageObject . If yes , it will register PageObjectInjectorListener in the TypeEncounter , so that PageObjectInjectorListener will be able to perform custom injections .
17802	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a list of Strings , one entry per line , using the default character encoding of the platform . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
17803	Returns < tt > true < /tt > if this type of attribute is unknown . The default implementation of this method always returns < tt > true < /tt > .
17813	Return < code > true < /code > if user defined as hidden to security management on client side ( e.g . SpaceBrowser application ) , otherwise < code > false < /code > .
17839	Creates a new < code > Uuid < /code > with the 128-bit value obtained by unmarshalling a binary representation from the supplied < code > InputStream < /code > . < p > Specifically , this method reads 16 bytes from the stream , and then it creates a new < code > Uuid < /code > with the 128-bit value represented by those bytes interpreted in network ( big-endian ) byte order .
17840	Fired when a key is typed ( except F11 who toggle full screen ) . This is the equivalent of KeyListener.keyTyped ( KeyEvent e ) . Args : character ( character on the key ) , keyCode ( lwjgl Keyboard key code )

17973	Reports an error that occured while scanning . In a wellformed scanner ( no or only correct usage of yypushback ( int ) and a match-all fallback rule ) this method will only be called with things that `` Ca n't Possibly Happen '' . If this method is called , something is seriously wrong ( e.g . a JFlex bug producing a faulty scanner etc. ) . Usual syntax/scanner level error handling should be done in error fallback rules .
17987	Reflection Log -- Uses a reflection log to resolve reflective calls.. Load a reflection log from the given file and use this log to resolve reflective call sites . Note that when a log is given , the following other options have no effect : safe-forname , safe-newinstance .

18159	Naive Side Effect Tester -- Use a naive side effect analysis even if interprocedural information is available . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to true , Busy Code Motion uses the conservative side effect information provided by the NaiveSideEffectTester class , even if interprocedural information about side effects is available . The naive side effect analysis is based solely on the information available locally about a statement . It assumes , for example , that any method call has the potential to write and read all instance and static fields in the program . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and Soot is in whole program mode , then Busy Code Motion uses the side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester class . PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine which fields and statics may be written or read by a given statement . If whole program analysis is not performed , naive side effect information is used regardless of the setting of Naive Side Effect Tester .
18165	Returns the maximum number of bytes that can be read ( or skipped over ) from this audio input stream without blocking . This limit applies only to the next invocation of a < code > read < /code > or < code > skip < /code > method for this audio input stream ; the limit can vary each time these methods are invoked . Depending on the underlying stream , an IOException may be thrown if this stream is closed .

18229	This callback function is called when the connection used by the client is temporarily lost . The user could supply a different callback function via subclassing , however the default implementation should always be called in the override function in order for the connection retry as well as device synchronization to work properly .
18247	Returns the hash code of this grammar Because our .equals method is so complex , we just return a very simple hash that might avoid calls to the equals method a bit ...
18254	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this applyTransformToDestination . If this applyTransformToDestination makes any guarantees as to what order its elements are returned by its iterator , this method must return the elements in the same order . < p/ > < p > The returned array will be `` safe '' in that no references to it are maintained by this applyTransformToDestination . ( In other words , this method must allocate a new array even if this applyTransformToDestination is backed by an array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array . < p/ > < p > This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs .
18270	Verbose -- Print statistics about the resulting call graph . Setting this option to true causes Soot to print out statistics about the call graph computed by this phase , such as the number of methods determined to be reachable .
18290	Hook for allowing page to call exec ( ) . By default , this returns the result of shouldAllowNavigation ( ) . It 's generally unsafe to allow untrusted content to be loaded into a CordovaWebView , even within an iframe , so it 's best not to touch this .
18294	Resizes the internal array holding all the point matrices . The size of the array after the call will be twice the current size . All elements of the current array will be copied .
18307	< p > NOTE : due to introspection , this is a < b > slow < /b > method to call and should never be called during actual serialization or filtering of the property . Rather it is needed for traversal needed for things like constructing JSON Schema instances .
18315	Convert from a < code > URL < /code > to a < code > File < /code > . < p/ > From version 1.1 this method will decode the URL . Syntax such as < code > file : ///my % 20docs/file.txt < /code > will be correctly decoded to < code > /my docs/file.txt < /code > . Starting with version 1.5 , this method uses UTF-8 to decode percent-encoded octets to characters . Additionally , malformed percent-encoded octets are handled leniently by passing them through literally .
18316	This method will compare double values for its equality and also it will preserve the -0.0 and 0.0 equality as per == , also preserve NaN equality check as per java.lang.Double.equals ( )
18324	This method notifies the end of an entity . < p/ > < strong > Note : < /strong > This method is not called for entity references appearing as part of attribute values .

18386	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a String using the default character encoding of the platform . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
18392	Whether or not this frame provider stops when the first frame touches the last input sample . When this returns true , the last frame will be the first one including the last sample ; when this returns false , the last frame will be the last that still contains any data . Defaults to true .
18423	Use a string path to load configurations matching a resource name from the class path which are not from jars into Configuration objects . This differentiation generally provides for only the local src directories to supply the resource instances , preventing injection of unwanted resources from class path entries .
18428	This method downloads a remote file from the server to a local file . Calling this method blocks the current thread until the operation is completed . The operation could be interrupted by another thread calling abortCurrentDataTransfer ( ) . The method will break with a FTPAbortedException .

18458	Propagate All String Constants -- Propagate all string constants , not just class names . When this option is set to false , Spark only distinguishes string constants that may be the name of a class loaded dynamically using reflection , and all other string constants are lumped together into a single string constant node . Setting this option to true causes all string constants to be propagated individually .
18463	Un-sets the appropriate bit in the 'from ' variable to remove the indication that the registrar referenced by this class was discovered via the mechanism identified by the input parameter . If , after un-setting the appropriate bit , the 'from ' variable is equal to 0 ( indicating the registrar was previously discovered by neither group nor locator discovery ) , this method returns < code > true < /code > ; otherwise it returns < code > false < /code > , which indicates that the registrar was still discovered by the `` opposite '' mechanism from that identified by the input parameter . This method is typically called during the discard process ; and the value input should always be either FROM_GROUP or FROM_LOCATOR .
18465	Generates the getType method for cursor based on field . There 're couple of unusual conditions . If field type is boolean , generate getInt method . If field type is char , generate getString method . If field type is Date , generate getLong method . If filed type is Integer , generate getInt method . If field type is bytes , generate getBlob method .
18472	Pre Jimplify -- Jimplify all methods before starting Paddle . When this option is set to true , Paddle converts all available methods to Jimple before starting the points-to analysis . This allows the Jimplification time to be separated from the points-to time . However , it increases the total time and memory requirement , because all methods are Jimplified , rather than only those deemed reachable by the points-to analysis .
18482	Get the optional double value associated with an index . NaN is returned if there is no value for the index , or if the value is not a number and can not be converted to a number .
18484	Copy and convert bytes from a < code > byte [ ] < /code > to chars on a < code > Writer < /code > , using the specified encoding .
18485	Returns the default attributes associated with this element type . Attributes of type CDATA that do n't have default values are typically not included .

18596	Similar to the C # Int.TryParse where you pass in a string and if no good it will use the default value which is also parsed ... which seems odd now I think about it TODO investigate if the second argument could be an int
18623	This allows you to add extra LoadingLayout instances to this proxy . This is only necessary if you keep your own instances , and want to have them included in any
18629	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a list of Strings , one entry per line , using the specified character encoding . < p/ > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .

18662	Field Based -- Use a field-based rather than field-sensitive representation . When this option is set to true , fields are represented by variable ( Green ) nodes , and the object that the field belongs to is ignored ( all objects are lumped together ) , giving a field-based analysis . Otherwise , fields are represented by field reference ( Red ) nodes , and the objects that they belong to are distinguished , giving a field-sensitive analysis .
18663	Generates an instance of the builder that will set up and initialize the form ( after setting up the form it is mandatory to initialize it calling init ( ) )
18675	< code > subtract < /code > subtracts the values of a given vector from those of this vector storing the result in the given vector object . If the provided vector is null , an exception is thrown .

18692	Paints the graph to the provided graphics context , for output to a printer . This method does not double buffer the painting , in order to provide the maximum print quality . < b > This method may not be working correctly , and will be repaired at a later date. < /b >
18694	This important method makes sure that all paragraph effects are applied to whole paragraphs . While it 's optimized for performance it 's still an expensive operation so it should n't be called too often .
18703	This method checks whether two grammars are the same . Currently , we compare the root element names for DTD grammars and the target namespaces for Schema grammars . The application can override this behaviour and add its own logic .
18745	Handles exceptions . < p > OkHttp notifies callers of cancellations via an IOException . If IOException is caught after request cancellation , then the exception is interpreted as successful cancellation and onCancellation is called . Otherwise onFailure is called .
18750	Set the Sounds to be played when a Pull Event happens . You specify which sound plays for which events by calling this method multiple times for each event . < p/ > If you 've already set a sound for a certain event , and add another sound for that event , only the new sound will be played .

19400	Use this method very carefully . It can easily lead to a deadlock . executes the transactional command in a separate thread with a custom number of retries . Using a separate thread creates a brand new transactional context and therefore this transaction will not join the context of any outer transactions . For example , if the outer transaction rolls back , this command will not . Calling this method will lead to deadlock if the outer transaction has locked any object that will be accessed in this transaction . It can also lead to deadlock if the same table is accessed in the outer transaction as this command . It can also lead to a deadlock if the connection pool is tied up in the outer transaction and has nothing left for this command .

If < code > listener < /code > is null , or was never added for the specified property , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .
19442	Reports an error that occurred while scanning . In a well-formed scanner ( no or only correct usage of yypushback ( int ) and a match-all fallback rule ) this method will only be called with things that `` Ca n't Possibly Happen '' . If this method is called , something is seriously wrong ( e.g . a JFlex bug producing a faulty scanner etc. ) . Usual syntax/scanner level error handling should be done in error fallback rules .
19483	Binds a preference 's summary to its value . More specifically , when the preference 's value is changed , its summary ( line of text below the preference title ) is updated to reflect the value . The summary is also immediately updated upon calling this method . The exact display format is dependent on the type of preference .

This steps builds a < code > Stream & lt ; IntStream & gt ; < /code > . < /p > < p > Then int summary statistics are computed on each < code > IntStream < /code > using a < code > collect ( ) < /code > call , and a < code > Stream & lt ; IntSummaryStatistics & gt ; < /code > is returned. < /p > < p > The resulting stream has the same number of elements as the provided stream , minus the size of the window width , to preserve consistency of each collection . < /p > < p > A < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown if the provided stream or the mapper is null. < /p >
19493	Returns a newly created empty mutable permission collection for < code > GrantPermission < /code > instances . The < code > implies < /code > method of the returned < code > PermissionCollection < /code > instance is defined as follows : for a given < code > GrantPermission g < /code > , let < code > c ( g ) < /code > denote the set of all permissions contained within < code > g < /code > or within arbitrarily nested < code > GrantPermission < /code > s inside < code > g < /code > , excluding nested < code > GrantPermission < /code > s themselves . Then , a < code > GrantPermission g < /code > is implied by the < code > PermissionCollection pc < /code > if and only if each permission in < code > c ( g ) < /code > is implied by the union of < code > c ( p ) < /code > for all < code > p < /code > in < code > pc < /code > . < p > Implication of contained < code > java.security.UnresolvedPermission < /code > s is special-cased : an < code > UnresolvedPermission p1 < /code > is taken to imply another < code > UnresolvedPermission p2 < /code > if and only if the serialized representations of < code > p1 < /code > and < code > p2 < /code > are identical .

19572	Clear the internally stored spanning tree . Any new calls to a getSpanningTree ( ) method will generate a new spanning tree instance as needed . This method is primarily useful for subclasses . For example , calling this method on a Tree instance will revert the state to the original rooted tree such that a sbusequent call to getSpanningTree ( ) will return the backing Tree itself .
19592	Creates a user and injects into the security context with username `` username '' . Requires < code > identifiableObjectManager < /code > and < code > userService < /code > to be injected into the test .
19599	Trim Static Initializer Edges -- Removes redundant static initializer calls . The call graph contains an edge from each statement that could trigger execution of a static initializer to that static initializer . However , each static initializer is triggered only once . When this option is enabled , after the call graph is built , an intra-procedural analysis is performed to detect static initializer edges leading to methods that must have already been executed . Since these static initializers can not be executed again , the corresponding call graph edges are removed from the call graph .

19662	Loads the list of objects into the cache ( single threaded here ) . Uses < code > getWithLoader ( ) < /code > Ehcache method rather than < code > load ( ) < /code > method since the latter starts a new thread .
19663	Returns the character at position < tt > pos < /tt > from the matched text . It is equivalent to yytext ( ) .charAt ( pos ) , but faster
19669	Iterate through the the field 's path tokens and when reached to a collection , iterate through its items for property matching ( collection [ * ] .property = ? ) or call match for regular contains ( collection [ * ] = ? ) . The target object should be of ServerEntry type which is passed from the relevant Range object .

19715	Reports an error that occured while scanning . In a wellformed scanner ( no or only correct usage of yypushback ( int ) and a match-all fallback rule ) this method will only be called with things that `` Ca n't Possibly Happen '' . If this method is called , something is seriously wrong ( e.g . a JFlex bug producing a faulty scanner etc. ) . Usual syntax/scanner level error handling should be done in error fallback rules .
19727	Unsets the specified path . If the path points to a dynamic property or a map key it will be removed , if it points to a fixed property it will be set to null , in that case , the target path must point to a nullable property otherwise an error will occur .

21817	GigaSpaces creates static resources implicitly when creating GigaSpaces components , such as remote/embedded space proxies . When using GigaSpaces outside of GigaSpaces containers ( GSC ) and processing unit , in some scenarios this resources should be cleaned up when no longer needed . This is relevant when hosting GigaSpaces components inside other application server which create a new class loader per deployment , which loads GigaSpaces libraries into that class loader each time . When this class loader is unloaded ( Due to undeployment of the application/service ) , this method should be called to cleanup the resources which were created implicitly . This method shutdown GigaSpaces runtime , once invoked the GigaSpaces runtime is destroyed and can not be reused in the current class loader which it was created in , as a result this is an irreversible process . This will only cleanup threads and resources which are created implicitly when using GigaSpaces runtime , it will not clean up resources the user has explicitly created such as space proxies , space instances and other components , this components needs to be destroyed explicitly by the creator . This should only be used when using GigaSpaces runtime outside of GigaSpaces containers ( GSC ) , and only if GigaSpaces libraries are loaded into new class loader on each deployment and not shared across multiple class loaders .

22331	Pre Jimplify -- Jimplify all methods before starting Spark . When this option is set to true , Spark converts all available methods to Jimple before starting the points-to analysis . This allows the Jimplification time to be separated from the points-to time . However , it increases the total time and memory requirement , because all methods are Jimplified , rather than only those deemed reachable by the points-to analysis .
22337	Creates a file Uri for a file defined by its absolute path . The method can handle the case of an absolute path ( e.g . /data/data ... . ) and a Uri path containing the file : // scheme ( e.g . file : ///data/data ... )

22498	Closes the underlying < code > Reader < /code > quietly . This method is useful if you only want to process the first few lines of a larger file . If you do not close the iterator then the < code > Reader < /code > remains open . This method can safely be called multiple times .
22512	Create lazy points-to sets -- Create lazy points-to sets that create context information only when needed.. When this option is disabled , context information is computed for every query to the reachingObjects method . When it is enabled , a call to reachingObjects returns a lazy wrapper object that contains a context-insensitive points-to set . This set is then automatically refined with context information when necessary , i.e . when we try to determine the intersection with another points-to set and this intersection seems to be non-empty .
22545	Get the optional string value associated with an index . It returns an empty string if there is no value at that index . If the value is not a string and is not null , then it is coverted to a string .
22579	SCIPIO : Renders the named screen using the render environment configured when this ScreenRenderer was created , and returns the result as a string ( instead of directly to writer ) .

This rolling stream is the same the one built using the < code > roll ( ) < /code > method . < /p > < p > Then each substream is collected using the collector passed as the third parameter. < /p > < p > The result is set up in a stream that has the same number of elements as the provided stream , minus the size of the window width , to preserve consistency of each collection . < /p > < p > A < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown if the provided stream or the collector is null. < /p >
23649	Fabricates a non-unique UUID value for the specified timestamp . Do NOT use this as a unique identifier . It 's only useful for performing range comparisons using a TimeUUID-aware comparator .
23675	Schedule a new invoker , increasing the total number of scheduled invokers for this listener container , but only if the specified `` maxConcurrentConsumers '' limit has not been reached yet , and only if this listener container does not currently have idle invokers that are waiting for new messages already . < p > Called once an event has been received , to scale up while processing the event in the invoker that originally received it .
23685	Sets the position relative to the current position where the sprite will be drawn . If origin , rotation , or scale are changed , it is slightly more efficient to translate after those operations .
23703	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to an < code > OutputStream < /code > line by line , using the specified character encoding and the specified line ending . < p > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > .

23723	Comma-separated list of objects attached to a comment . The field is submitted the following way : `` type '' '' owner_id '' _ '' media_id '' '' < p > `` '' type '' '' - media attachment type : `` photo '' - photo `` video '' - video `` audio '' - audio `` doc '' - document < p > `` '' owner_id '' '' - media owner id `` '' media_id '' '' - media attachment id < p > For example : photo100172_166443618 , photo66748_265827614
23731	Convert an optional duration to a metric value . The returned metric value is expressed as the duration in milliseconds . If the Optional is empty , an empty metric value is emitted .
23739	Writes a byte array to a file creating the file if it does not exist . < p/ > NOTE : As from v1.3 , the parent directories of the file will be created if they do not exist .
23743	Animates the rendering of the chart on the y-axis with the specified animation time . If animate ( ... ) is called , no further calling of invalidate ( ) is necessary to refresh the chart .
23747	Saves the snapshot to an external ( user defined ) destination . Default implementation does nothing , custom implementations should open a Save File dialog and save the snapshot to selected destination . Throws an UnsupportedOperationException if supportsSaveAs ( ) returns false .
23763	Indicates whether this is a logical OR query , meaning that a query string is specified and instances which matches this query on one or more attributes should be included in the response . The opposite is an item-specific query , where the instances which matches the specific attributes should be included .
23766	Reads a `` large '' uleb128 . That is , one that may legitimately be greater than a signed int . The value is returned as if it were signed . i.e . a value of 0xFFFFFFFF would be returned as -1 . It is up to the caller to handle the value appropriately .
23795	Reconstruct Jimple body after inlining -- . When a method with array parameters is inlined , its variables may need to be assigned different types than they had in the original method to produce compilable code . When this option is set , Soot re-runs the Jimple Body pack on each method body which has had another method inlined into it so that the typing algorithm can reassign the types .
23801	Generates key for memory cache for incoming image ( URI + size ) . < br / > Pattern for cache key - < b > [ imageUri ] _ [ width ] x [ height ] < /b > .
23815	Demand-driven refinement-based context-sensitive points-to analysis -- After running Spark , refine points-to sets on demand with context information . When this option is set to true , Manu Sridharan 's demand-driven , refinement-based points-to analysis ( PLDI 06 ) is applied after Spark was run .
23830	Attaches a listener so the summary is always updated with the preference value . Also fires the listener once , to initialize the summary ( so it shows up before the value is changed . )
23837	Get an optional double associated with a key , or NaN if there is no such key or if its value is not a number . If the value is a string , an attempt will be made to evaluate it as a number .
23840	Removes the `` file : // '' prefix from the given URI string , if applicable . If the given URI string does n't have a `` file : // '' prefix , it is returned unchanged .
23856	A start of either a mixed or children content model . A mixed content model will immediately be followed by a call to the < code > pcdata ( ) < /code > method . A children content model will contain additional groups and/or elements .
23877	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . This version of the call is used for Views that need to specify a Scroll Range but scroll back to it 's edge correctly .
23891	< p > Generates a stream of < code > Map.Entry & lt ; E , E & gt ; < /code > elements with all the cartesian product of the elements of the provided stream with itself . < /p > < p > For a stream < code > { a , b , c } < /code > , a stream with the following elements is created : < code > { ( a , a ) , ( a , b ) , ( a , c ) , ( b , a ) , ( b , b ) , ( b , c ) , ( c , a ) , ( c , b ) , ( c , c ) } < /code > , where < code > ( a , b ) < /code > is the < code > Map.Entry < /code > with key < code > a < /code > and value < code > b < /code > . < /p > < p > A < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown if the provided stream is null. < /p >
23892	Returns < tt > true < /tt > if the iteration has more elements . ( In other words , returns < tt > true < /tt > if < tt > next < /tt > would return an element rather than throwing an exception . )
23893	Returns the greater of two < code > float < /code > values . That is , the result is the argument closer to positive infinity . If the arguments have the same value , the result is that same value . Does none of the special checks for NaN or -0.0f that < code > Math.max < /code > does .
23926	Indicates whether this user credentials is a super user , implying that the ALL authority is present in at least one of the user authority groups of this user credentials .
23928	Free a Context acquired by getCacheContext ( ) . If Context was taken from the pool , it will be returned to it . Otherwise , it was allocated on demand , and will be collected by the JVM GC . Make sure to call this method from within a finally block to release any acquired Contexts .
23994	Returns true if the time is in the PM or `` after noon '' . Note : we follow the convention that 12:00 NOON is PM and 12 MIDNIGHT is AM
24007	Adds a data table to this visualization , using the given data group name . A visual abstraction of the data will be created and registered with the visualization . An exception will be thrown if the group name is already in use .
24009	Release a read lock , wait the given period of time or until notified by notifier , then obtain a read lock again . Throws ConcurrentLockException if the thread gets interrupted ; in that case , the read lock is still held .
24025	Get the contents of a < code > Reader < /code > as a String . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > .
24038	SAX DTDHandler API . < p/ > < p > Captured here only to detect the end of the prolog so that we can ignore subsequent oasis-xml-catalog PIs . Otherwise the events are just passed through. < /p >
24046	The start of a content model . Depending on the type of the content model , specific methods may be called between the call to the startContentModel method and the call to the endContentModel method .
24061	Returns true if there were errors during scanning of this input file or string . The BuildLexerBase may attempt to recover from errors , but clients should not rely on the results of scanning if this flag is set .
24076	Helper method for reading value from an objectMapper that occurs many times in code . Another advantage of it is to handle exception so that client code does n't have to wrap themselves inside a try-catch block
24086	Resolves the gives location into a URL object for use in various ways . The general format of the location is like a URL : { locationType } : //location/path/file.ext Supports standard locationTypes like http , https , ftp , jar , & file Supports a classpath location type for when desired to be used like any other URL Supports OFBiz specific location types like ofbizhome and component Supports additional locationTypes specified in the locationresolvers.properties file
24094	Resets the cursor to a specific value . This can be applied at any time , but it is worth noting that it can cause a data race and should only be used in controlled circumstances . E.g . during initialisation .
24095	This is a giant and unsecure HACK ! The response is digitally signed only , when the communication mode is set to REAL ( overeni=false ) and the response is valid ( which can not be checked in advance ) . So our only change is to check the signature only , when the communication is set to real and there is no error in response .
24098	Combines the national number with any prefix ( IDD/+ and country code or national prefix ) that was collected . A space will be inserted between them if the current formatting template indicates this to be suitable .
24109	During deserialization of an instance of this class , if it is found that the stream contains no data , this method is automatically invoked . Because it is expected that the stream should always contain data , this implementation of this method simply declares that something must be wrong .
24157	Adds the buttons ( and other controls ) to the screen in question . Called when the GUI is displayed and when the window resizes , the buttonList is cleared beforehand .
24162	Hook to allow setting variables that are not run or validation specific , based on options . Sample use case are remote logging , test harnesses and others . Called after command line options are parsed , but before a file is read or a run started .
24168	Safe forName -- Handle Class.forName ( ) calls conservatively . When a program calls Class.forName ( ) , the named class is resolved , and its static initializer executed . In many cases , it can not be determined statically which class will be loaded , and which static initializer executed . When this option is set to true , Soot will conservatively assume that any static initializer could be executed . This may make the call graph very large . When this option is set to false , any calls to Class.forName ( ) for which the class can not be determined statically are assumed to call no static initializers .
24175	Signal that the splash screen is now hidden . It is used to record for how long the splash screen was left visible . It is also used to know what event triggered the splash screen to be hidden .
24188	Use older type assigner -- Enables the older type assigner . This enables the older type assigner that was in use until May 2008 . The current type assigner is a reimplementation by Ben Bellamy that uses an entirely new and faster algorithm which always assigns the most narrow type possible . If compare-type-assigners is on , this option causes the older type assigner to execute first . ( Otherwise the newer one is executed first . )
24202	Return a tap target for the overflow button from the given toolbar < p > < b > Note : < /b > This is currently experimental , use at your own risk
24208	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a list of Strings , one entry per line , using the default character encoding of the platform . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
24218	SCIPIO : Builds an Ofbiz navigation full link ( with HTTPS as necessary ) , where possible inferring < em > some < /em > of its properties by analyzing the passed URI ( < code > url < /code > ) and < code > webSiteId < /code > .
24225	Creates a Gson instance that converts by default a time stamp to a long value . Furthermore , in case of an < code > Object < /code > field it does not try to deserialize the object but stores instead the Json String to that field . The deserialization has then to be handled in an extra step once the final Object class information is available .
24233	Returns whether the editor input exists . < p > This method is primarily used to determine if an editor input should appear in the `` File Most Recently Used '' menu . An editor input will appear in the list until the return value of < code > exists < /code > becomes < code > false < /code > or it drops off the bottom of the list .
24244	Indictes if the end visible flag is set to true . This is the visibility value consulted for the ending value of the visibility field at the end of an animated transition .
24264	Returns whether the permission is enabled in Android , both globally and per-app . If the permission does not have a per-app setting or a global setting , true is assumed for either that is missing ( or both ) .
24268	NOTE : this native method is not documented in JDK API . It should have the side effect : System.in = parameter private static native void setIn0 ( java.io.InputStream ) ;
24292	Dump HTML -- Dump pointer assignment graph to HTML for debugging . When this option is set to true , a browseable HTML representation of the pointer assignment graph is output to a file called pag.jar after the analysis completes . Note that this representation is typically very large .
24303	Based on name put in ServletRequest or from List in ServletRequest ; If the brackets for a list are empty the value will be appended to the list , otherwise the value will be set in the position of the number in the brackets . If a `` + '' ( plus sign ) is included inside the square brackets before the index number the value will inserted/added at that point instead of set at the point .
24304	Smoothes input signal . The definition of the input is lower than the pixel density of the screen so we need to smooth the input to give the illusion of smooth animation on screen from chunky inputs . The combination of 30 pixels and 0.8f ensures that the output is not more than 6 pixels away from the target . TODO ( dtrainor ) : This has nothing to do with time , just draw rate . Is this okay or do we want to have the interpolation based on the time elapsed ?
24308	Returns all the text in the given file with the given encoding . If the file can not be read ( non-existent , etc . ) , then and only then the method returns < code > null < /code > .
24313	Checks if the specified template matches the specified entry . Assumes template is a superclass of entry ( in the wider sense ) . Assumes template and entry are not deleted , expired .
24328	Starts collecting metrics for the latest intent sent to DocumentActivity or ChromeTabbedActivity . This happens on every intent coming from launcher/external app for DocumentActivity and every time we get onStart ( ) in ChromeTabbedActivity mode .
24329	Determine if the given target type is assignable from the given value type , assuming setting by reflection . Considers primitive wrapper classes as assignable to the corresponding primitive types .
24330	Two instances of this class are equal if both have the same minimum start , the same maximum start , the same minimum stop , and the same maximum stop .
24338	If somebody is unlucky enough to have to serialize one of these , serialize it as a LinkedHashMap so that they wo n't need Gson on the other side to deserialize it . Using serialization defeats our DoS defence , so most apps should n't use it .
24356	Deletes a file , never throwing an exception . If file is a directory , delete it and all sub-directories . < p/ > The difference between File.delete ( ) and this method are : < ul > < li > A directory to be deleted does not have to be empty. < /li > < li > No exceptions are thrown when a file or directory can not be deleted. < /li > < /ul >
24360	Returns True when the file described by 'file ' in the ownCloud account 'account ' is downloading or waiting to download . If 'file ' is a directory , returns 'true ' if any of its descendant files is downloading or waiting to download .
24364	Compute the convolution of two signals , by multiplying them in the frequency domain . Normalise the result with respect to deltaT ( the inverse of the sampling rate ) . This is the core method , requiring two signals of equal length , which must be a power of two , and not checking for pollution arising from the assumed periodicity of both signals .
24365	On Fly Call Graph -- Build call graph as receiver types become known . When this option is set to true , the call graph is computed on-the-fly as points-to information is computed . Otherwise , an initial CHA approximation to the call graph is used .
24366	Thread stack dump interval , use when block happens , BlockCanary will dump on main thread stack according to current sample cycle . < p > Because the implementation mechanism of Looper , real dump interval would be longer than the period specified here ( especially when cpu is busier ) . < /p >
24384	Tests an argument for < code > null < /code > . < p > < code > Assert.notNull ( `` foo '' , foo ) ; < /code > < /p >
24391	This method clears the style added . This will set the mode to Styler.Mode.NONE and saturation to 1 ( default value ) . But this does not clear the brightness and contrast , if these two params are set . Note if animation is enabled , this method will also have animation effect .
24401	Appends an Animation to the current animation set and starts it immediately . If the set is already finished or does n't exist , the animation set is also started .
24410	Add a Time column with no restrictions on the min/max allowable times < b > NOTE < /b > : Time columns are represented by LONG ( epoch millisecond ) values . For time values in human-readable formats , use String columns + StringToTimeTransform
24442	Identify unknown faces from an person group . < p > For each face in the faceIds array , Face Identify will compute similarity for the face among all faces within a person group ( given by personGroupId ) , and returns candidate person ( s ) for that face ranked by similarity confidence . The person group should be trained to make it ready for identify . See more in Person Group - Train Person Group . < p > Remarks : < p > The algorithm allows more than one face to be isIdentified , but the no more than 10 faces . Each person in the person group could have more than one face , but no more than 64 faces . Identification works well for frontal faces and near-frontal faces . Number of candidates returned is restricted by maxNumOfCandidatesReturned . If no person is isIdentified , the candidate returned will be an empty array . Try Face - Find Similar when you need to identify similar faces from a face list instead of a person group .
24444	Resets the < code > count < /code > field of this byte array output stream to zero , so that all currently accumulated output in the output stream is discarded . The output stream can be used again , reusing the already allocated buffer space .
24456	Configures a List < ExpandableItem > to be shown . By default , the list of ExpandableItems is going to be shown collapsed . Please take into account that this method creates ImageButton/Button widgets based on the size of the list passed as parameter . Do n't use this library as a RecyclerView and take into account the number of elements to show .
24472	Method checks if ContainerState is mapped to ContainerDescription which is `` Discovered '' . The only difference between this method and the one in SystemContainerDescriptions is that this one will return false if check is against system container .
24487	The position of the control ( one of the map corners ) . < /br > default `` topright '' < /br > possible values : `` topleft '' , `` topright '' , `` bottomleft '' , `` bottomright ''
24493	< code > multLocal < /code > multiplies a provided vector to this vector internally , and returns a handle to this vector for easy chaining of calls . If the provided vector is null , null is returned .
24499	Convert the specified string to an input stream , encoded as bytes using the specified character encoding . < p/ > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > .
24503	Context-sensitive Heap Locations -- Treat allocation sites context-sensitively . When this option is set to true , the context-sensitivity level that is set for the context-sensitive call graph and for pointer variables is also used to model heap locations context-sensitively . When this option is false , heap locations are modelled context-insensitively regardless of the context-sensitivity level .
24515	Simply check if any component with a specific css class name is NOT in parsys . Do not use it with negation , because of performance issues . In such cases use { # link isComponentPresent } .
24519	Updates the action with the new begin position in world coordinates . < p > This is used if the action is carried out over a time period in which the user would like visual feedback .
24529	Any subsequent configuration of this builder , until the next or ( ) call ( or build ( ) /buildArray ( ) ) , will be logically AND 'd with whatever came previously . Note that this is the default state or the builder , so you only need an and ( ) to reverse a previous or ( ) .
24543	Binds a preference 's summary to its value . More specifically , when the preference 's value is changed , its summary ( line of text below the preference title ) is updated to reflect the value . The summary is also immediately updated upon calling this method . The exact display format is dependent on the type of preference .
24552	Set the Sounds to be played when a Pull Event happens . You specify which sound plays for which events by calling this method multiple times for each event . < p/ > If you 've already set a sound for a certain event , and add another sound for that event , only the new sound will be played .
24558	Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this one . These mappings replace any mappings that this map had for any of the keys currently in the specified map .
24564	the second phase is reached if the templateHolder enters the cache and is being matched by a different ( later ) call ( thread ) this flag is used to avoid sending a response twice to the client .
24567	List of objects attached to the comment , in the following format : `` type '' '' owner_id '' _ '' media_id '' `` '' type '' '' - Type of media attachment : `` photo '' - photo `` video '' - video `` audio '' - audio `` doc '' - document `` '' owner_id '' '' - ID of the media attachment owner . `` `` media_id '' '' - Media attachment ID . < p > For example : photo100172_166443618 , photo66748_265827614

24578	< p > Generates a stream that is computed from a provided stream following two steps. < /p > < p > The first steps maps this stream to an < code > LongStream < /code > that is then rolled following the same principle as the < code > roll ( ) < /code > method . This steps builds a < code > Stream & lt ; LongStream & gt ; < /code > . < /p > < p > Then long summary statistics are computed on each < code > LongStream < /code > using a < code > collect ( ) < /code > call , and a < code > Stream & lt ; LongSummaryStatistics & gt ; < /code > is returned. < /p > < p > The resulting stream has the same number of elements as the provided stream , minus the size of the window width , to preserve consistency of each collection . < /p > < p > A < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown if the provided stream or the mapper is null. < /p >
24580	Convert a group+metric to a wavefront name . Concatenates the paths of a Group and a Metric , separating each path element with a dot ( '. ' ) . Example : - group path : [ 'example ' , 'group ' , 'path ' ] - and metric : [ 'metric ' , 'name ' ] are concatenated into `` example.group.path.metric.name '' . The concatenated name is cleaned to only contain characters allowed by wavefront . ( See the WavefrontString.name ( String ) function . )

24643	Shutdown the LRMI runtime , once invoked the LRMI runtime is permanently destroyed and can not be reused in the current class loader which it was created in . As a result this operation is irreversible .
24668	Convert the specified CharSequence to an input stream , encoded as bytes using the specified character encoding . < p/ > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > .
24670	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a String using the specified character encoding . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > . < /p >
24671	Get the optional JSONObject associated with an index . Null is returned if the key is not found , or null if the index has no value , or if the value is not a JSONObject .
24672	Writes chars from a < code > char [ ] < /code > to a < code > Writer < /code > using the default character encoding of the platform .
24682	Remove a range of characters from the node 's value . Throws a DOMException if the offset is beyond the end of the string . However , a deletion _count_ that exceeds the available data is accepted as a delete-to-end request .
24692	Return a new plain object that contains all the properties of this object except the ones defined in the exclude list e.g { a:1 , b:2 , c:3 } .exclude ( `` a '' , '' c '' ) would result in { b:2 }

24741	Contextually encodes the characters of string that are either non-ASCII characters or are ASCII characters that must be percent-encoded using the UTF-8 encoding . Percent-encoded characters will be recognized and not double encoded .
24747	Unlock the flushing mechanism to make a buffer be able to be flushed by other thread . Note that the thread unlocking this mechanism must be the same thread as the one locking .
24752	A type is reifiable if it either refers to a non-parameterized type , is a raw type , is a parameterized type with only unbound wildcard parameters or is an array type with a reifiable type parameter .
24754	Returns whether this vector is in an axis-aligned bounding box . < p > The minimum and maximum vectors given must be truly the minimum and maximum X , Y and Z components .
24758	Refresh the underlying Connection , not returning before an attempt has been successful . < p > The default implementation pings the space until a successful ping has been established .
24803	Date to show statistics from . For different value of `` period '' different date format is used : 'day ' : 'YYYY-MM-DD ' , example : 2011-09-27 - September 27 , 2011 ' 0 ' - day it was created on ; 'month ' : 'YYYY-MM ' , example : 2011-09 - September 2011 ' 0 ' - month it was created in ; 'overall ' : 0 .
24806	Writes chars from a < code > char [ ] < /code > to a < code > Writer < /code > using the default character encoding of the platform .

If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to true , Lazy Code Motion uses the conservative side effect information provided by the NaiveSideEffectTester class , even if interprocedural information about side effects is available . The naive side effect analysis is based solely on the information available locally about a statement . It assumes , for example , that any method call has the potential to write and read all instance and static fields in the program . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and Soot is in whole program mode , then Lazy Code Motion uses the side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester class . PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine which fields and statics may be written or read by a given statement . If whole program analysis is not performed , naive side effect information is used regardless of the setting of Naive Side Effect Tester .

25630	Appends a new member to the end of this object , with the specified name and the JSON representation of the specified < code > int < /code > value . < p > This method < strong > does not prevent duplicate names < /strong > . Calling this method with a name that already exists in the object will append another member with the same name . In order to replace existing members , use the method < code > set ( name , value ) < /code > instead . However , < strong > < em > add < /em > is much faster than < em > set < /em > < /strong > ( because it does not need to search for existing members ) . Therefore < em > add < /em > should be preferred when constructing new objects . < /p >

25647	This method sends a custom command to the server . Do n't use this method to send standard commands already supported by the client : this should cause unexpected results .
25652	Verbose -- Print warnings about where the call graph may be incomplete . Due to the effects of native methods and reflection , it may not always be possible to construct a fully conservative call graph . Setting this option to true causes Soot to point out the parts of the call graph that may be incomplete , so that they can be checked by hand .

25676	Determine whether the given child view should be considered dirty . < p > If a property determined by the Behavior such as other dependent views would change , the Behavior should report a child view as dirty . This will prompt the CoordinatorLayout to re-query Behavior-determined properties as appropriate. < /p >
25700	We use the same space proxy we obtained in the session and we write another External Entry , which will have a class name of 'TempQueue ' . The only message consumers that can consume from a temporary destination are those created by the same connection that created the destination . Any message producer can send to the temporary destination . If you close the connection that a temporary destination belongs to , the destination is closed and its contents lost . You can use temporary destinations to implement a simple request/reply mechanism . If you create a temporary destination and specify it as the value of the JMSReplyTo message header field when you send a message , the consumer of the message can use the value of the JMSReplyTo field as the destination to which it sends a reply and can also reference the original request by setting the JMSCorrelationID header field of the reply message to the value of the JMSMessageID header field of the request .

25798	Appends a new member to the end of this object , with the specified name and the JSON representation of the specified < code > double < /code > value . < p > This method < strong > does not prevent duplicate names < /strong > . Calling this method with a name that already exists in the object will append another member with the same name . In order to replace existing members , use the method < code > set ( name , value ) < /code > instead . However , < strong > < em > add < /em > is much faster than < em > set < /em > < /strong > ( because it does not need to search for existing members ) . Therefore < em > add < /em > should be preferred when constructing new objects . < /p >

26061	MySQL is funny when it comes to timestamps and dates . More specifically , for a DDL statement like 'MYCOLUMN timestamp ( 3 ) ' : - MySQL 5.6.4+ has support for timestamps/dates with millisecond ( or smaller ) precision . The DDL above works and the data in the table will have millisecond precision - MySQL < 5.5.3 allows the DDL statement , but ignores it . The DDL above works but the data wo n't have millisecond precision - MySQL 5.5.3 < [ version ] < 5.6.4 gives and exception when using the DDL above . Also , the 5.5 and 5.6 branches of MySQL are both actively developed and patched . Hence , when doing auto-upgrade/creation of the Activiti tables , the default MySQL DDL file is used and all timestamps/datetimes are converted to not use the millisecond precision by string replacement done in the method below . If using the DDL files directly ( which is a sane choice in production env . ) , there is a distinction between MySQL version < 5.6 .
26066	If a preferred list exists relative to the first URL of this loader 's path , sets this loader 's PreferredResources according to that preferred list . If no preferred list exists relative to the first URL , leaves this loader 's PreferredResources null .

26351	Attempts to cancel this request . This attempt will fail if the request has already completed , has already been cancelled , or could not be cancelled for some other reason . If successful , and this request has not started when cancel is called , this request should never run . If the request has already started , then the mayInterruptIfRunning parameter determines whether the thread executing this request should be interrupted in an attempt to stop the request . < p > & nbsp ; < /p > After this method returns , subsequent calls to isDone ( ) will always return true . Subsequent calls to isCancelled ( ) will always return true if this method returned true .
26356	The caller could call this before any actions , which to hold the lock for the write handler of its whole lifecycle . The lock will only be released when closing the write handler . This method is useful to prevent releasing underlying zookeeper lock during recovering/completing log segments . Releasing underlying zookeeper lock means 1 ) increase latency when re-lock on starting new log segment . 2 ) increase the possibility of a stream being re-acquired by other instances .

26437	Converts this rich text to another rich text . The default implementation does n't support any conversion except the one to itself ( which is technically no conversion ) . < p > The method has to make sure that the original rich text is n't modified . It does however not make sure that the returned RTText is n't referencing the original RTText meaning modifying the resulting object might also modify the original object .

26571	only support auto load lib/armeabi-v7a library from patch . in some process , you may not want to install tinker and you can load patch dex and library without install tinker ! }
26576	Main working method . You may be surprised that here , just 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' is called . But internally , it works like this : AudioSystem.write ( ) contains a loop that is trying to read from the passed AudioInputStream . Since we have a special AudioInputStream that gets its data from a TargetDataLine , reading from the AudioInputStream leads to reading from the TargetDataLine . The data read this way is then written to the passed File . Before writing of audio data starts , a header is written according to the desired audio file type . Reading continues untill no more data can be read from the AudioInputStream . In our case , this happens if no more data can be read from the TargetDataLine . This , in turn , happens if the TargetDataLine is stopped or closed ( which implies stopping ) . ( Also see the comment above . ) Then , the file is closed and 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' returns .

26582	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . < p/ > This should only be used on AdapterView 's such as ListView as it just calls through to overScrollBy ( ) with the scrollRange = 0 . AdapterView 's do not have a scroll range ( i.e . getScrollY ( ) does n't work ) .
26583	Appends a new member to the end of this object , with the specified name and the JSON representation of the specified string . < p > This method < strong > does not prevent duplicate names < /strong > . Calling this method with a name that already exists in the object will append another member with the same name . In order to replace existing members , use the method < code > set ( name , value ) < /code > instead . However , < strong > < em > add < /em > is much faster than < em > set < /em > < /strong > ( because it does not need to search for existing members ) . Therefore < em > add < /em > should be preferred when constructing new objects . < /p >
26584	< p > Unescapes a string containing entity escapes to a string containing the actual Unicode characters corresponding to the escapes . Supports HTML 4.0 entities. < /p > < p/ > < p > For example , the string `` & amp ; lt ; Fran & amp ; ccedil ; ais & amp ; gt ; '' will become `` & lt ; Fran & ccedil ; ais & gt ; '' < /p > < p/ > < p > If an entity is unrecognized , it is left alone , and inserted verbatim into the result string . e.g . `` & amp ; gt ; & amp ; zzzz ; x '' will become `` & gt ; & amp ; zzzz ; x '' . < /p >

26738	This method notifies the start of a general entity . < p/ > < strong > Note : < /strong > This method is not called for entity references appearing as part of attribute values .
26762	Returns the hash code value for this map . The hash code of a map is defined to be the sum of the hashCodes of each entry in the map 's entrySet view . This ensures that < tt > t1.equals ( t2 ) < /tt > implies that < tt > t1.hashCode ( ) ==t2.hashCode ( ) < /tt > for any two maps < tt > t1 < /tt > and < tt > t2 < /tt > , as required by the general contract of Object.hashCode .
26767	Checkout the remote resources into the local workspace as projects . Each resource will be checked out into the corresponding project .

26855	Include a lease in the managed set until a specified time and with a specified renewal duration . < p > This method takes as arguments : a reference to the lease to manage , the desired expiration time of the lease , the renewal duration time for the lease , and a reference to the < code > LeaseListener < /code > object that will receive notification of exceptional conditions when attempting to renew this lease . The < code > LeaseListener < /code > argument may be < code > null < /code > . < p > If the < code > lease < /code > argument is < code > null < /code > , a < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown . If the < code > desiredExpiration < /code > argument is < code > Lease.FOREVER < /code > , the < code > renewDuration < /code > argument may be < code > Lease.ANY < /code > or any positive value ; otherwise , the < code > renewDuration < /code > argument must be a positive value . If the < code > renewDuration < /code > argument does not meet these requirements , an < code > IllegalArgumentException < /code > will be thrown . < p > If the lease passed to this method is already in the set of managed leases , the listener object , the desired expiration , and the renewal duration associated with that lease will be replaced with the new listener , desired expiration , and renewal duration . < p > The lease will remain in the set until one of the following occurs : < ul > < li > The lease 's desired or actual expiration time is reached . < li > An explicit removal of the lease from the set is requested via a < code > cancel < /code > , < code > clear < /code > , or < code > remove < /code > call on the renewal manager . < li > The renewal manager tries to renew the lease and gets a bad object exception , bad invocation exception , or < code > LeaseException < /code > . < /ul > < p > This method will interpret the value of the < code > desiredExpiration < /code > argument as the desired absolute system time after which the lease is no longer valid . This argument provides the ability to indicate an expiration time that extends beyond the actual expiration of the lease . If the value passed for this argument does indeed extend beyond the lease 's actual expiration time , then the lease will be systematically renewed at appropriate times until one of the conditions listed above occurs . If the value is less than or equal to the actual expiration time , nothing will be done to modify the time when the lease actually expires . That is , the lease will not be renewed with an expiration time that is less than the actual expiration time of the lease at the time of the call . < p > If the < code > LeaseListener < /code > argument is a non- < code > null < /code > object reference , it will receive notification of exceptional conditions occurring upon a renewal attempt of the lease . In particular , exceptional conditions include the reception of a < code > LeaseException < /code > , bad object exception , or bad invocation exception ( collectively these are referred to as < em > definite exceptions < /em > ) during a renewal attempt or the lease 's actual expiration being reached before its desired expiration . < p > If a definite exception occurs during a lease renewal request , the exception will be wrapped in an instance of the < code > LeaseRenewalEvent < /code > class and sent to the listener . < p > If an indefinite exception occurs during a renewal request for the lease , renewal requests will continue to be made for that lease until : the lease is renewed successfully , a renewal attempt results in a definite exception , or the lease 's actual expiration time has been exceeded . If the lease can not be successfully renewed before its actual expiration is reached , the exception associated with the most recent renewal attempt will be wrapped in an instance of the < code > LeaseRenewalEvent < /code > class and sent to the listener . < p > If the lease 's actual expiration is reached before the lease 's desired expiration time , and either 1 ) the last renewal attempt succeeded or 2 ) there have been no renewal attempts , a < code > LeaseRenewalEvent < /code > containing a < code > null < /code > exception will be sent to the listener .
26873	Returns an unmodifiable JsonObject for the specified one . This method allows to provide read-only access to a JsonObject . < p > The returned JsonObject is backed by the given object and reflect changes that happen to it .

26921	This is an advice method that wraps around the intercepted method . It should not be called directly by Bobcat 's user . < p > If the intercepted methods comes from Object class , the advice calls this method directly . Otherwise , it switches to frame associated with the intercepted method , performs the method and switches back .
26924	Add an X509TrustManager to the ones being governed by this composite . Ideally , this implements X509Extensions . If not , it will be wrapped in an X509ExtensionsWrapper , to try to call additional methods via reflection .

26939	Inserts the specified object into the data at the specified location . The object is inserted before the current element at the specified location . If the location is equal to the size of the data , the object is added at the end . If the location is smaller than the size of the data , then all elements beyond the specified location are moved by one location towards the end of the data .
26958	Compute the square of the distance between two vectors . < p > Calling this method is equivalent to calling : < code > p1.subtract ( p2 ) .getNormSq ( ) < /code > except that no intermediate vector is built < /p >

26990	Set the Sounds to be played when a Pull Event happens . You specify which sound plays for which events by calling this method multiple times for each event . < p/ > If you 've already set a sound for a certain event , and add another sound for that event , only the new sound will be played .
26996	Gets the magnitude of the location , defined as sqrt ( x^2+y^2+z^2 ) . The value of this method is not cached and uses a costly square-root function , so do not repeatedly call this method to get the location 's magnitude . NaN will be returned if the inner result of the sqrt ( ) function overflows , which will be caused if the length is too long . Not world-aware and orientation independent .
27008	Adds the objects in the specified collection to the end of the data . The objects are added in the order in which they are returned from the collection 's iterator .
27010	Give the host application a chance to take over the control when a new url is about to be loaded in the current WebView . If WebViewClient is not provided , by default WebView will ask Activity Manager to choose the proper handler for the url . If WebViewClient is provided , return true means the host application handles the url , while return false means the current WebView handles the url . This method is not called for requests using the POST `` method '' .
27022	Reports an error that occured while scanning . In a wellformed scanner ( no or only correct usage of yypushback ( int ) and a match-all fallback rule ) this method will only be called with things that `` Ca n't Possibly Happen '' . If this method is called , something is seriously wrong ( e.g . a JFlex bug producing a faulty scanner etc. ) . Usual syntax/scanner level error handling should be done in error fallback rules .
27023	Clones the equipment configuration . Be careful The contained maps will NOT be cloned . So if you try to access for example the contained data tags the references to them will still be the same .
27029	A subscription can be accessed if either of the following conditions are met : < ol > < li > The subscription is owned by the provider user. < /li > < li > The provided user has explicit permission to act as an owner of this subscription ( typically reserved for administrators ) . < /li > < /ol >
27035	Deletes the content of a thing shadow . This is a blocking call , so the calling thread will be blocked until the operation succeeded , failed , or timed out .

27088	Compute the convolution of two signals , by multipying them in the frequency domain . Normalise the result with respect to deltaT ( the inverse of the sampling rate ) . This method applies zero padding where necessary to ensure that the result is not polluted because of assumed periodicity . The two signals need not be of equal length .
27091	Removes an instance of < code > ServiceRegistrar < /code > from the managed set of lookup services , making the corresponding lookup service eligible for re-discovery . This method takes no action if the parameter input to this method is < code > null < /code > , or if it does not match ( using < code > equals < /code > ) any of the elements in the managed set .
27107	Advances the position until after the next newline character . If the line is terminated by `` \r\n '' , the '\n ' must be consumed as whitespace by the caller .
27112	Updates the content of a thing shadow with the data provided in the request . This is a blocking call , so the calling thread will be blocked until the operation succeeded , failed , or timed out .
27114	Copy bytes from an < code > InputStream < /code > to an < code > OutputStream < /code > . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > . < p/ > Large streams ( over 2GB ) will return a bytes copied value of < code > -1 < /code > after the copy has completed since the correct number of bytes can not be returned as an int . For large streams use the < code > copyLarge ( InputStream , OutputStream ) < /code > method .
27125	If the application decides to terminate parsing before the xml document is fully parsed , the application should call this method to free any resource allocated during parsing . For example , close all opened streams .

27190	Removes the specified element from this applyTransformToDestination if it is present ( optional operation ) . More formally , removes an element < tt > e < /tt > such that < tt > ( o==null & nbsp ; ? & nbsp ; e==null & nbsp ; : & nbsp ; o.equals ( e ) ) < /tt > , if this applyTransformToDestination contains such an element . Returns < tt > true < /tt > if this applyTransformToDestination contained the element ( or equivalently , if this applyTransformToDestination changed as a result of the call ) . ( This applyTransformToDestination will not contain the element once the call returns . )

27196	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to the specified < code > File < /code > line by line . The specified character encoding and the default line ending will be used . < p > NOTE : As from v1.3 , the parent directories of the file will be created if they do not exist .
27207	Tests if an argument is not null and is an instance of a specified class . < p > < code > Assert.isInstanceOf ( `` foo '' , foo , Foo.class ) ; < /code > < /p >
27213	Transform to context-insensitive result -- Transform to context-insensitive result .

After the transformation , the context sensitive points-to quries can not be answered .
27222	Serializes an object and returns the Base64-encoded version of that serialized object . < p > As of v 2.3 , if the object can not be serialized or there is another error , the method will throw an java.io.IOException . < b > This is new to v2.3 ! < /b > In earlier versions , it just returned a null value , but in retrospect that 's a pretty poor way to handle it. < /p > The object is not GZip-compressed before being encoded .
27238	Simplify Offline -- Collapse single-entry subgraphs of the PAG . When this option is set to true , variable ( Green ) nodes which form single-entry subgraphs ( so they must have the same points-to set ) are merged before propagation begins .
27239	Determines if the given phonene is stressed . To determine stress , this method relies upon a phone ending in the number `` 1 '' . Subclasses should override this method if stresses are determined in other ways .
27245	Gets the set of unique path parameters used in the given URI . If a parameter is used twice in the URI , it will only show up once in the set .
27254	Provides access to the key of the mapping at the iterator 's position . Note that you must < tt > advance ( ) < /tt > the iterator at least once before invoking this method .
27262	Notifies of the presence of a TextDecl line in an entity . If present , this method will be called immediately following the startParameterEntity call . < p/ > < strong > Note : < /strong > This method is only called for external parameter entities referenced in the DTD .
27265	Attempts to cancel this request . This attempt will fail if the request has already completed , has already been cancelled , or could not be cancelled for some other reason . If successful , and this request has not started when cancel is called , this request should never run . If the request has already started , then the mayInterruptIfRunning parameter determines whether the thread executing this request should be interrupted in an attempt to stop the request . < p > & nbsp ; < /p > After this method returns , subsequent calls to isDone ( ) will always return true . Subsequent calls to isCancelled ( ) will always return true if this method returned true .
27286	Returns whether the preference needs to display a soft input method when the dialog is displayed . Default is false . Subclasses should override this method if they need the soft input method brought up automatically .
27316	Parses a single SVG path and returns it as a < code > android.graphics.Path < /code > object . An example path is < code > M250,150L150,350L350,350Z < /code > , which draws a triangle .
27344	Reset the time limit to 0 . Only the thread who initiated the latest time limit can also take it back . If another thread tries to reset the time limit , it is ignored .
27358	This test is cheap but is NOT exact . Use Intersects ( ) if you want a more accurate and more expensive test . Note that when this method is used by an S2RegionCoverer , the accuracy is n't all that important since if a cell may intersect the region then it is subdivided , and the accuracy of this method goes up as the cells get smaller .
27379	Formats a bytes value to String . Use this method to make sure the value appears in the same format as used in the chart ( tooltip ) . Useful for updating details area . < br > < br > < b > Note : < /b > This method must be called in the Event Dispatch Thread .

27563	Returns true if the current [ language ] is equivalent to the [ language ] that was in effect on the include parent , taking case-insensitivity into account as per [ RFC 3066 ] . This method should < em > only < /em > be called when the current element is a top level included element , i.e . the direct child of a fallback element , or the root elements in an included document . The `` include parent '' is the element which , in the result infoset , will be the direct parent of the current element .
27565	Sends a broadcast when a new operation is added to the queue . Local broadcasts are only delivered to activities in the same process , but ca n't be done sticky : \

27614	WARNING ! This requires arbitrary precision arithmetic to be truly robust . This means that for nearly colinear AB and AC , this function may return the wrong answer . < p > Like SimpleCCW ( ) , but returns +1 if the points are counterclockwise and -1 if the points are clockwise . It satisfies the following conditions : ( 1 ) RobustCCW ( a , b , c ) == 0 if and only if a == b , b == c , or c == a ( 2 ) RobustCCW ( b , c , a ) == RobustCCW ( a , b , c ) for all a , b , c ( 3 ) RobustCCW ( c , b , a ) ==-RobustCCW ( a , b , c ) for all a , b , c In other words : ( 1 ) The result is zero if and only if two points are the same . ( 2 ) Rotating the order of the arguments does not affect the result . ( 3 ) Exchanging any two arguments inverts the result . This function is essentially like taking the sign of the determinant of a , b , c , except that it has additional logic to make sure that the above properties hold even when the three points are coplanar , and to deal with the limitations of floating-point arithmetic . Note : a , b and c are expected to be of unit length . Otherwise , the results are undefined .
27618	Provides access to the value of the mapping at the iterator 's position . Note that you must < tt > advance ( ) < /tt > the iterator at least once before invoking this method .
27637	This method resumes a download operation from the remote server to a local file . Calling this method blocks the current thread until the operation is completed . The operation could be interrupted by another thread calling abortCurrentDataTransfer ( ) . The method will break with a FTPAbortedException .
27641	Format method for the d conversion character and int argument . < p/ > For d format , the flag character '- ' , means that the output should be left justified within the field . The default is to pad with blanks on the left . A '+ ' character means that the conversion will always begin with a sign ( + or - ) . The blank flag character means that a non-negative input will be preceded with a blank . If both a '+ ' and a ' ' are specified , the blank flag is ignored . The ' 0 ' flag character implies that padding to the field width will be done with zeros instead of blanks . < p/ > The field width is treated as the minimum number of characters to be printed . The default is to add no padding . Padding is with blanks by default . < p/ > The precision , if set , is the minimum number of digits to appear . Padding is with leading 0s .

27661	Treat EMPTY as Alloc -- Treat singletons for empty sets etc . as allocation sites . When this option is set to true , Spark treats references to EMPTYSET , EMPTYMAP , and EMPTYLIST as allocation sites for HashSet , HashMap and LinkedList objects respectively , and references to Hashtable.emptyIterator as allocation sites for Hashtable.EmptyIterator . This enables subsequent analyses to differentiate different uses of Java 's immutable empty collections .

27688	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . < p/ > This should only be used on AdapterView 's such as ListView as it just calls through to overScrollBy ( ) with the scrollRange = 0 . AdapterView 's do not have a scroll range ( i.e . getScrollY ( ) does n't work ) .
27716	Validates the input . < p > The default implementation of this framework method delegates the request to the supplied input validator object ; if it finds the input invalid , the error message is displayed in the dialog 's message line . This hook method is called whenever the text changes in the input field . < /p >
27723	Code processor should be created ones at start . But processor creation is not guarantee that classifier is available . Not trained classifier is not ready to use & must be trained soon as possible . The main cases why code processor is not available is : 1 ) processor is not created yet & classifier not trained 2 ) processor created , but occurs an error on classifier train 3 ) processor created , classifier start train , but not finished ( 3rd case is ok , it 's temporary unavailability & awaiting for training ) In 3rd case , user awaiting for train accomplish to get code processor and then take classifier to perform language classifying ( see below ) .

Attributes include age , gender , smile intensity , facial hair and head-pose . Face ID is for other APIs use including Face - Identify , Face - Verify , and Face - Find Similar . The face ID will expire in 24 hours after detection call . JPEG , PNG , GIF ( the first frame ) , and BMP are supported . The image file size should be no larger than 4MB . The detectable face size is between 36x36 to 4096x4096 pixels . The faces out of this range will not be detected . A maximum of 64 faces could be returned for an image . The returned faces are ranked by face rectangle size in descending order . Some faces may not be detected for technical challenges , e.g . very large face angles ( head-pose ) or large occlusion . Frontal and near-frontal faces have the best results . Attributes ( age , gender , headPose , smile and facialHair , and glasses ) are still experimental and may not be very accurate . HeadPose 's pitch value is reserved as 0 .

27902	Checks if an element is present in the vector . The check follows the convention of HashSet contains ( ) function , so performance can be expected to be a constant factor .
27914	Reports an error that occured while scanning . In a wellformed scanner ( no or only correct usage of yypushback ( int ) and a match-all fallback rule ) this method will only be called with things that `` Ca n't Possibly Happen '' . If this method is called , something is seriously wrong ( e.g . a JFlex bug producing a faulty scanner etc. ) . Usual syntax/scanner level error handling should be done in error fallback rules .
27919	Allow picking files of all image MIME types . This is set by default so unless other MIME type changes were made to request there 's no need to call it
27927	Verify if the java virtual machine is in a very low memory condition . The memory is considered very low if less than half a specified value is still available for processing . `` Available '' memory is calculated using < code > availableMemory ( ) < /code > .The threshold value can be specified as the Mary property mary.lowmemory ( in bytes ) . It defaults to 20000000 bytes.instantiateModule

27953	Propagate All String Constants -- Propagate all string constants , not just class names . When this option is set to false , Spark only distinguishes string constants that may be the name of a class loaded dynamically using reflection , and all other string constants are lumped together into a single string constant node . Setting this option to true causes all string constants to be propagated individually .
27956	ID of forwarded messages , separated with a comma . Listed messages of the sender will be shown in the message body at the recipient 's . < p > Example : 123,431,544

28054	If the destination should ask for confirmation . Some destinations might chose to ignore this flag either because it does n't apply to them or because the always ask for confirmation in certain circumstances . < p > But in general , any destination that could do accidental damage to a repository should not ignore when the value is true .
28064	Promote the listed participants ( from a subtransaction ) into this ( the parent ) transaction . This method is for use by the manager of a subtransaction when the subtransaction commits . At this point , all participants of the subtransaction must become participants in the parent transaction . Prior to this point , the subtransaction 's manager was a participant of the parent transaction , but after a successful promotion it need no longer be one ( if it was not itself a participant of the subtransaction ) , and so it may specify itself as a participant to drop from the transaction . Otherwise , participants should not be dropped out of transactions . For each promoted participant , the participant 's crash count is stored in the corresponding element of the < code > crashCounts < /code > array .
28069	Returns the number of blocks required to compute the aggregation , which is one pass through the sorted table . It does < em > not < /em > include the one-time cost of materializing and sorting the records .
28070	If true , panning will always be animated if possible . If false , it will not animate panning , either resetting the map view if panning more than a screen away , or just setting a new offset for the map pane ( except for ` panBy ` which always does the latter ) . < /br >
28096	Closes the underlying < code > Reader < /code > quietly . This method is useful if you only want to process the first few lines of a larger file . If you do not close the iterator then the < code > Reader < /code > remains open . This method can safely be called multiple times .

28770	Discards the registrar referenced in this class from either the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > or < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > utility employed by this < code > LookupDiscoveryManager < /code > . The utility from which that registrar is discarded is dependent on whether the registrar was previously discovered via group or both group and locator discovery , or via locator discovery alone . This method enables a mechanism for sequentially `` chaining '' the discard process of the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > utility with the discard process of the < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > . That is , rather than discarding the registrar from both utilities at the same time , by invoking this method , the registrar will be discarded from only one of those utilities . Then when the discarded event is received by the listener registered with the utility from which the registrar was discarded , the listener - based on the current discovered state of the registrar - determines whether to : discard the registrar from the other utility , send a discarded event out to the client 's listener , or simply update state and do nothing more . This chaining mechanism helps to present a single event source to the client listeners . That is , even though the two discovery utilities used internally by this < code > LookupDiscoveryManager < /code > operate independently , sending discarded events to the group discovery listener and/or the locator discovery listener , this chaining mechanism enables the coordination of those separate events so that only one event is sent to the client listeners , even though multiple events may have been received here . Although this chaining mechanism is helpful in coordinating the discarded events received from the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > and < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > utilities , the actual reason it must be used is due to the fact that < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > can send a certain type of discarded event - referred to as `` passive communication discard '' ; whereas < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > can not . Recall that < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > monitors the registrars it has discovered for reachability , whereas < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > does not . When the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > sends a passive communication discard because it has determined that one of its registrars has become unreachable , if that registrar was also discovered via locator discovery , it is necessary to discard the registrar from the < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > as well . In that case , this method is called to create a discard chain which ultimately will result in the registrar being discarded from the < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > .

29143	Naive Side Effect Tester -- Use a naive side effect analysis even if interprocedural information is available . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to true , Busy Code Motion uses the conservative side effect information provided by the NaiveSideEffectTester class , even if interprocedural information about side effects is available . The naive side effect analysis is based solely on the information available locally about a statement . It assumes , for example , that any method call has the potential to write and read all instance and static fields in the program . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and Soot is in whole program mode , then Busy Code Motion uses the side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester class . PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine which fields and statics may be written or read by a given statement . If whole program analysis is not performed , naive side effect information is used regardless of the setting of Naive Side Effect Tester .

29283	Add a configuration resource . The properties of this resource will override properties of previously added resources , unless they were marked < a href= '' # Final '' > final < /a > .
29289	Returns < tt > true < /tt > if this map maps one or more keys to the specified value . More formally , returns < tt > true < /tt > if and only if this map contains at least one mapping to a value < tt > v < /tt > such that < tt > ( value==null ? v==null : value.equals ( v ) ) < /tt > . This operation will probably require time linear in the map size for most implementations of the < tt > Map < /tt > interface .
29297	Get a filename property from the underlying properties , throwing an exception if it is not defined . The string MARY_BASE is replaced with the value of the property mary.base , and path separators are adapted to the current platform .
29318	Is this instruction a `` beginning instruction '' . A beginning instruction is defined to be an instruction that can be the first successfully executed instruction in the method . The first instruction is always a beginning instruction . If the first instruction can throw an exception , and is covered by a try block , then the first instruction of any exception handler for that try block is also a beginning instruction . And likewise , if any of those instructions can throw an exception and are covered by try blocks , the first instruction of the corresponding exception handler is a beginning instruction , etc . To determine this , we simply check if the first predecessor is the fake `` StartOfMethod '' instruction , which has an instruction index of -1 .
29322	Delete the task with given ID , or , to be precise , ensure that the task with given ID does n't exist anymore . This call wo n't fail even if there 's nothing to delete ( inspired by HTTP DELETE method behavior ) .
29323	Escape quotes in the value that can cause the shell problems ( and prevent injection ) This does n't escape spaces as it is assumed that the value will be wrapped in quotes This escaping is bash specific - might not work with other shells The way to escape a single quote inside single quotes in bash is by gluing a double-quoted single quote to the single quoted expression
29327	Update the DataTag object held in the cache with the provided values . Notice that the datatag quality is not validated and needs to be done independently using the validate public method .
29328	This operation generates a description of an image in human readable language with complete sentences . The description is based on a collection of content tags , which are also returned by the operation . More than one description can be generated for each image . Descriptions are ordered by their confidence score . All descriptions are in English .
29331	If a patch fails to install because Studio is locking some of the files , we have to restart studio . Ask if the user wants to , and then move things into place so they can be picked up on restart .

29412	Some permissions fall into one of the following categories : < ol > < li > The permission is intended for validation purposes only , such as for creating a table. < /li > < li > The permission format is deprecated and no new permissions of the format are allowed. < /li > < /ol > This method returns true if the permission should be assignable to a user/role , false otherwise .
29418	This method reads property files and creates following bindings : < ul > < li > a named binding for each property , < li > a binding for Properties class ; bound Property instance contains all the properties . < /ul > Property file paths are retrieved from configuration.paths property . If configuration.paths is not set , bindProperties will look in default location , i.e . `` src/main/config '' . Property configuration.paths can contain any number of paths . Paths in configuration.paths should be separated with semicolons .
29429	FixedClassNames -- Set for the fixed class names.. Use this parameter to set some class names unchangable even they are duplicated . The fixed class name list can not contain duplicated class names . Using '- ' to split multiple class names ( e.g. , fcn : a.b.c-a.b.d ) .
29430	PageObjectInjectorListener calls this method to check if the provider is able to handle currently injected field . < p > PageObjectListProxyProvider handles fields that are : < ul > < li > lists of PageObjects , < li > annotated with one of FindBy annotations . < /ul >
29431	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . < p/ > This should only be used on AdapterView 's such as ListView as it just calls through to overScrollBy ( ) with the scrollRange = 0 . AdapterView 's do not have a scroll range ( i.e . getScrollY ( ) does n't work ) .
29436	Closing a < tt > ByteArrayOutputStream < /tt > has no effect . The methods in this class can be called after the stream has been closed without generating an < tt > IOException < /tt > .
29437	< p > Specify an exception handler to be used for any future event handlers. < /p > < p > < p > Note that only event handlers set up after calling this method will use the exception handler. < /p >
29443	Get the contents of a < code > Reader < /code > as a < code > byte [ ] < /code > using the specified character encoding . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > .
29480	A single preview frame will be returned to the handler supplied . The data will arrive as byte [ ] in the message.obj field , with width and height encoded as message.arg1 and message.arg2 , respectively .
29502	Here the actual processing of the frequency-domain frame ( in cartesian coordinates ) happens . This implementation converts to polar coordinates calls processPolar ( ) , and converts the result back to cartesian coordinates .
29509	Adds a component to the parser configuration . This method will also add all of the component 's recognized features and properties to the list of default recognized features and properties .
29564	Reset the instance from another one . < p > The updated instance is completely independant of the original one . A deep reset is used none of the underlying object is shared. < /p >
29574	If true , all the tiles that are not visible after panning are placed in a reuse queue from which they will be fetched when new tiles become visible ( as opposed to dynamically creating new ones ) . This will in theory keep memory usage low and eliminate the need for reserving new memory whenever a new tile is needed . < /br > default false
29582	Convert a pokemon/trainer level to a < em > level index < /em > ( < code > levelIdx < /code > in code ) . The mapping is invertible , but level indexes can be used to index an array ( like Data.CpM ) , or seekbars . < p/ > Pokemon levels go from 1 to trainerLevelToMaxPokeLevel ( trainerLevel ) , in increments of 0.5 . Level indexes go from 0 to trainerLevelToMaxPokeLevelIdx ( trainerLevel ) in increments of 1 . This method adjusts a level to a < em > level index < /em > ( < code > levelIdx < /code > ) , by doubling it and subtracting 2 .
29594	This function is included to allow the containing tile to directly and efficiently modify the energy contained in the EnergyStorage . Do not rely on this externally , as not all IEnergyHandlers are guaranteed to have it .
29597	Return true if and only if the given point is contained in the interior of the region ( i.e . the region excluding its boundary ) . The point ' p ' does not need to be normalized .
29628	Attempts to cancel this request . This attempt will fail if the request has already completed , has already been cancelled , or could not be cancelled for some other reason . If successful , and this request has not started when cancel is called , this request should never run . If the request has already started , then the mayInterruptIfRunning parameter determines whether the thread executing this request should be interrupted in an attempt to stop the request . < p > & nbsp ; < /p > After this method returns , subsequent calls to isDone ( ) will always return true . Subsequent calls to isCancelled ( ) will always return true if this method returned true .
29637	Determine the current amount of overscroll . If the value is 0 , there is no overscroll . If the value is < 0 , tabs are overscrolling towards the top or or left . If the value is > 0 , tabs are overscrolling towards the bottom or right .

29647	Compute the distance between two vectors according to the L < sub > 1 < /sub > norm . < p > Calling this method is equivalent to calling : < code > v1.subtract ( v2 ) .getNorm1 ( ) < /code > except that no intermediate vector is built < /p >
29659	Implements InputStream.read ( int ) in terms of InputStream.read ( byte [ ] , int , int ) . InputStream assumes that you implement InputStream.read ( int ) and provides default implementations of the others , but often the opposite is more efficient .
29668	Enables the line to be drawn in dashed mode , e.g . like this `` - - - - - - '' . THIS ONLY WORKS IF HARDWARE-ACCELERATION IS TURNED OFF . Keep in mind that hardware acceleration boosts performance .
29672	Recompute SSA form . < p > Note : assumes presence of Phi nodes in body that require elimination . If you *know* there are no Phi nodes present , you may prefer to use rebuild ( false ) in order to skip some transformations during the Phi elimination process .
29675	Return a List of Element objects that have the given name and are immediate children of the given element ; if name is null , all child elements will be included .
29681	Searches the list for values which do < b > not < /b > satisfy < tt > condition < /tt > . This is akin to *nix < code > grep -v < /code > .
29685	Defines a new character reference . The reference 's name and value are supplied . Nothing happens if the character reference is already defined . < p/ > Unlike internal entities , character references are a string to single character mapping . They are used to map non-ASCII characters both on parsing and printing , primarily for HTML documents . ' & lt ; amp ; ' is an example of a character reference .
29694	Determines if a given bitmap is dark . This extracts a palette inline so should not be called with a large image ! ! < p > Note : If palette fails then check the color of the central pixel
29696	Return a particular one of several possible Observables based on a case selector and run it on the designated scheduler . < p > < img width= '' 640 '' src= '' https : //raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/switchCase.s.png '' alt= '' '' >
29699	< p > Generates a stream that is computed from a provided long stream by first rolling it in the same way as the < code > roll ( ) < /code > method does . The average is then computed on each substream , to form the final double stream . No boxing / unboxing is conducted in the process . < p > The resulting stream has the same number of elements as the provided stream , minus the size of the window width , to preserve consistency of each collection . < /p > < p > A < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown if the provided stream is null. < /p >
29701	Blob IDs must be ASCII strings . between 1 and 255 characters in length . Whitespace , ISO control characters and certain punctuation characters that are n't generally allowed in file names are excluded .
29707	Serialization has to be avoided by static analyses , since each object comes out of the same place . private static native java.lang.Object allocateNewObject ( java.lang.Class , java.lang.Class ) throws java.lang.InstantiationException , java.lang.IllegalAccessException ;
29708	Reconstruct Jimple body after inlining -- . When a method with array parameters is inlined , its variables may need to be assigned different types than they had in the original method to produce compilable code . When this option is set , Soot re-runs the Jimple Body pack on each method body which has had another method inlined into it so that the typing algorithm can reassign the types .
29713	List hashCode : the hashcode of a list is a function of each of its elements . The hashCode for a list is defined in the documentation of the List interface : https : //docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html # hashCode % 28 % 29 Note that Lombok wo n't generate the correct equals ( ) and hashCode ( ) , as it will compare the members of the object , none of which has a defined equality and thus will never compare equal .
29714	Returns the mean of the ( signed ) differences between corresponding elements of the input arrays -- i.e. , sum ( sample1 [ i ] - sample2 [ i ] ) / sample1.length .
29717	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a character array using the default character encoding of the platform . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
29727	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to the specified < code > File < /code > line by line , optionally appending . The specified character encoding and the default line ending will be used .
29730	Returns < code > true < /code > if and only if other holds the same alloc nodes as this . Note that equals ( ) is not overwritten on purpose . This is because Spark relies on comparison by object identity .
29738	Helper method that should be called each time a change is made to the underlying alarm . We should schedule a new alarm with the AlarmManager any time a change is made , even when it was not the alarm 's time that changed . This is so that we cancel and update the PendingIntent 's extra data with the most up-to-date Alarm 's values . The effect of this is to guarantee that the Intent that will launch RingtoneActivity has the most up-to-date extra data about the updated alarm .
29739	Sends a CPQ Message Possible values for < code > message < /code > : < br > 1 : You do n't have enough CP to continue . 2 : You can no longer summon the Monster . 3 : You can no longer summon the being . 4 : This being is already summoned . 5 : This request has failed due to an unknown error .
29769	Return true if and only if the given point is contained in the interior of the region ( i.e . the region excluding its boundary ) . ' p ' should be a unit-length vector .
29779	Deep-clone a document , including fixing ownerDoc for the cloned children . Note that this requires bypassing the WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR protection . I 've chosen to implement it by calling importNode which is DOM Level 2 .
29793	Get the contents of a < code > Reader < /code > as a character array . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > .
29794	Ignorable whitespace . For this method to be called , the document source must have some way of determining that the text containing only whitespace characters should be considered ignorable . For example , the validator can determine if a length of whitespace characters in the document are ignorable based on the element content model .
29840	Calculates an overall distance as a function of the overall similarity . This method uses the < code > getOverallSimilarity < /code > method and returns its inverse if it has a non-zero value . Otherwise the return value is positive infinity .

29893	Resets the < code > count < /code > field of this byte array output stream to zero , so that all currently accumulated output in the output stream is discarded . The output stream can be used again , reusing the already allocated buffer space .
29907	Positions the scan before the first group . Internally , the underlying scan is always positioned at the first record of a group , which means that this method moves to the first underlying record .
29928	Sets the appropriate bit in the 'from ' variable to indicate the mechanism or mechanisms through which the registrar referenced by this class was discovered ( group discovery , locator discovery , or both ) . This method is typically called during the discovery process ; and the value input should always be either FROM_GROUP or FROM_LOCATOR .
29931	Adds a data table to this visualization , using the given data group name . A visual abstraction of the data will be created and registered with the visualization . An exception will be thrown if the group name is already in use .

29976	Local Name Standardization -- Uses naming scheme of the Local Name Standardizer.. If enabled , the Local Name Standardizer is applied whenever Shimple creates new locals . Normally , Shimple will retain the original local names as far as possible and use an underscore notation to denote SSA subscripts . This transformation does not otherwise affect Shimple behaviour .
29980	Returns true if ( current * 10 ) + digit is a number too large to be represented by an unsigned long . This is useful for detecting overflow while parsing a string representation of a number .
29991	This is a refactored version of Literal.parseLong which supports binary literals . This version of parseLong is implemented as an attribute rather than a static method . Perhaps some slight performance boost could be gained from keeping it static , but with the loss of declarative- and ReRAGness . There exists only a parseLong , and not a parseInteger . Parsing of regular integer literals works the same , but with stricter bounds requirements on the resulting parsed value .
30001	The goal is not to show this step until the user completes the wizard . So this page is only shown once , after the user clicks finish for the first time .
30007	If this method returns true , the region completely contains the given cell . Otherwise , either the region does not contain the cell or the containment relationship could not be determined .
30011	Finds the implementation Class object in the specified order . The specified order is the following : < ol > < li > query the system property using < code > System.getProperty < /code > < li > read < code > META-INF/services/ < i > factoryId < /i > < /code > file < li > use fallback classname < /ol >
30028	Query the content provider for data . < p > Loaders do queries in a background thread . They also provide a ContentObserver that is triggered when data in the content provider changes . When the sync adapter updates the content provider , the ContentObserver responds by resetting the loader and then reloading it .
30037	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . < p/ > This should only be used on AdapterView 's such as ListView as it just calls through to overScrollBy ( ) with the scrollRange = 0 . AdapterView 's do not have a scroll range ( i.e . getScrollY ( ) does n't work ) .
30047	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a character array using the specified character encoding . < p/ > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > . < p/ > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
30054	Closes this input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream . < p/ > This method will read any unread data in the MIME part so that the next part starts an an expected place in the parent < code > InputStream < /code > . Note that if the client code forgets to call this method on error , < code > MultipartParser < /code > will call it automatically if you call < code > readNextPart ( ) < /code > .
30060	Verifies that the array has at least 2 elements , and that the elements are all non-null and not ConstraintAlternatives instances , removes duplicates , modifying the array in place , verifies that there are still at least 2 elements , and returns an array containing the remaining elements .

30085	Create a Content service . The work is done in a separate method so that complex services that need this functionality do not need to incur the reflection performance penalty .
30090	DefaultDataCenters does n't actually directly require DataCenterAnnouncer . However , it is frequently the case that classes that depend on DefaultDataCenters will only operate correctly if the DataCenterAnnouncer has been started first . The following false dependency forces this injection order when appropriate .
30093	Compares two ItemStack instances if they reference the same object or are both null . If false , the method areEqual ( ) is called to check if the two instances reference the same item .
30103	Returns a Set representation of the subset of ALL_TEST_THROWABLES which are catchable by the argument < code > ThrowableSet < /code > ( for use in assertions about the catchable exceptions .
30108	Specifies an object to use as a point of reference for running an AB test . Typically you 'd just pass in < b > this < /b > from inside whichever class you 're doing the tests in .
30120	This will move the left side of the current viewport to the specified x-value on the x-axis , and center the viewport to the specified y value on the y-axis . This also refreshes the chart by calling invalidate ( ) .
30139	Called when the chooser is about to be shown and the current ringtone should be marked . Can return null to not mark any ringtone . < p > By default , this restores the previous ringtone URI from the persistent storage .
30165	Convert a well-formed ( but not necessarily valid ) XML string into a JSONObject using the JsonML transform . Each XML tag is represented as a JSONObject with a `` tagName '' property . If the tag has attributes , then the attributes will be in the JSONObject as properties . If the tag contains children , the object will have a `` childNodes '' property which will be an array of strings and JsonML JSONObjects . Comments , prologs , DTDs , and < code > & lt ; [ [ ] ] > < /code > are ignored .
30174	The playing time will expire in % *0 . If you wish to continue using the service , please make additional payments on the Billing Page of the Plaync website .
30180	Stops text editing on the display , hiding the text editing widget . If the text editor was associated with a specific VisualItem ( ie one of the editText ( ) methods which include a VisualItem as an argument was called ) , the item is updated with the edited text .
30193	Set the Sounds to be played when a Pull Event happens . You specify which sound plays for which events by calling this method multiple times for each event . < p/ > If you 've already set a sound for a certain event , and add another sound for that event , only the new sound will be played .

30250	Convenience methods for subclasses to use in throwing exceptions about badly behaved user objects employed as keys . We have to throw an IllegalArgumentException with a rather verbose message telling the user that they need to fix their object implementation to conform to the general contract for java.lang.Object .
30252	Reset the stream . If the stream has been marked , then attempt to reposition it at the mark . If the stream has not been marked , then attempt to reset it in some way appropriate to the particular stream , for example by repositioning it to its starting point . Not all character-input streams support the reset ( ) operation , and some support reset ( ) without supporting mark ( ) .
30254	Method can be used to get the block index .This can be used when multiple thread can be used scan group of blocks in that can we can assign the some of the blocks to one thread and some to other
30276	a list iterator is a problem for a composite list as going back in the order of the list is an issue , as are the other methods like set ( ) and add ( ) ( and especially , remove ) . Convert the internal lists to one list ( if not already just one list ) and return that list 's list iterator . < p/ > AFAIK list iterator is only commonly used in sorting .
30277	Inserts the array of < tt > values < /tt > into the list at < tt > offset < /tt > . All values including and to the right of < tt > offset < /tt > are shifted to the right .
30278	This method creates an alert which explains the need for the audio permissions , only when the user has denied permission once in history . Otherwise , it simply requests the permission .
30279	Unsubscribes to a given topic . This is a blocking call , so the calling thread is blocked until the unsubscribe operation completed , failed , or the specified timeout has elapsed .
30282	Types For Sites -- Represent objects by their actual type rather than allocation site . When this option is set to true , types rather than allocation sites are used as the elements of the points-to sets .
30286	Checks whether the extension of the filename is that specified . < p > This method obtains the extension as the textual part of the filename after the last dot . There must be no directory separator after the dot . The extension check is case-sensitive on all platforms .
30287	Puts the IndexedFrame descriptor on the frame stack , without performing switching . TargetLocator uses this method when Bobcat user does switching using webDriver directly . Do n't call this method manually .
30301	Removes the DataSet at the given index in the DataSet array from the data object . Also recalculates all minimum and maximum values . Returns true if a DataSet was removed , false if no DataSet could be removed .
30309	Waits until all events currently in the disruptor have been processed by all event processors and then halts the processors . It is critical that publishing to the ring buffer has stopped before calling this method , otherwise it may never return . < p > < p > This method will not shutdown the executor , nor will it await the final termination of the processor threads. < /p >

Example : photo100172_166443618
30330	< p > Resolves an external entity . If the entity can not be resolved , this method should return < code > null < /code > . This method only calls < code > resolveIdentifier < /code > and returns an input source if an entry was found in the catalog . It should be overridden if other behaviour is required. < /p >
30332	Updates the recovery plan if necessary . 1 . Updates existing blocks . 2 . If the needs recovery and does n't yet have a block in the plan , removes any COMPLETED blocks for this task ( at most one block for a given task can exist ) and creates a new PENDING block .

30374	Pre Jimplify -- Jimplify all methods before starting Paddle . When this option is set to true , Paddle converts all available methods to Jimple before starting the points-to analysis . This allows the Jimplification time to be separated from the points-to time . However , it increases the total time and memory requirement , because all methods are Jimplified , rather than only those deemed reachable by the points-to analysis .

30841	Insert Redundant Casts -- . Insert extra casts for the Java bytecode verifier . If the target method uses its this parameter , a reference to the receiver object must be passed to the static copy of the target method . The verifier may complain if the declared type of the receiver parameter does not match the type implementing the target method . Say , for example , that Singer is an interface declaring the sing ( ) method and that the call graph shows all receiver objects at a particular call site , singer.sing ( ) ( with singer declared as a Singer ) are in fact Bird objects ( Bird being a class that implements Singer ) . The virtual call singer.sing ( ) is effectively replaced with the static call Bird.staticsing ( singer ) . Bird.staticsing ( ) may perform operations on its parameter which are only allowed on Birds , rather than Singers . The Insert Redundant Casts option inserts a cast of singer to the Bird type , to prevent complaints from the verifier .

31214	Get the optional JSONObject associated with an index . Null is returned if the key is not found , or null if the index has no value , or if the value is not a JSONObject .
31221	Appends a new member to the end of this object , with the specified name and the specified JSON value . < p > This method < strong > does not prevent duplicate names < /strong > . Calling this method with a name that already exists in the object will append another member with the same name . In order to replace existing members , use the method < code > set ( name , value ) < /code > instead . However , < strong > < em > add < /em > is much faster than < em > set < /em > < /strong > ( because it does not need to search for existing members ) . Therefore < em > add < /em > should be preferred when constructing new objects . < /p >

32789	Compares the specified object with this < code > Uuid < /code > for equality . This method returns < code > true < /code > if and only if the specified object is a < code > Uuid < /code > instance with the same 128-bit value as this one .
32791	Produce a string in double quotes with backslash sequences in all the right places . A backslash will be inserted within < / , producing < \/ , allowing JSON text to be delivered in HTML . In JSON text , a string can not contain a control character or an unescaped quote or backslash .
32804	Sort order If no sort order is specified , topics are returned in the order specified by the group administrator . Pinned topics are returned first , regardless of the sorting .
32807	Specify if a Gradle sync should be performed at the end of the template execution . A false means do NOT perform a Gradle sync since we plan to do this later . Default : true .
32811	Read a single character . This method will block until a character is available , an I/O error occurs , or the end of the stream is reached . < p/ > < p > Subclasses that intend to support efficient single-character input should override this method .
32821	During deserialization of an instance of this class , if it is found that the stream contains no data , this method is automatically invoked . Because it is expected that the stream should always contain data , this implementation of this method simply declares that something must be wrong .
32829	Compute the square of the distance between two vectors . < p > Calling this method is equivalent to calling : < code > v1.subtract ( v2 ) .getNormSq ( ) < /code > except that no intermediate vector is built < /p >
32832	Writes a String to a file creating the file if it does not exist . < p/ > NOTE : As from v1.3 , the parent directories of the file will be created if they do not exist .
32833	< p > Creates the version object based on the dimension of the original bit matrix from the datamatrix code. < /p > < p > See ISO 16022:2006 Table 7 - ECC 200 symbol attributes < /p >
32848	Replaces an HTTP entity body with the specified binary contents . TODO : Currently this method only works for FullHttpMessages , since it must modify the Content-Length header ; determine if this may be applied to chunked messages as well
32853	Animates the rendering of the chart on the x-axis with the specified animation time . If animate ( ... ) is called , no further calling of invalidate ( ) is necessary to refresh the chart .
32863	Helper method for Overscrolling that encapsulates all of the necessary function . < p/ > This should only be used on AdapterView 's such as ListView as it just calls through to overScrollBy ( ) with the scrollRange = 0 . AdapterView 's do not have a scroll range ( i.e . getScrollY ( ) does n't work ) .
32864	Add a listener to be handed all certificate chains . Use this solely for diagnostic purposes ( e.g. , to understand what root CA to add to a network security configuration ) . Do not use this in production code .
32867	Simple Edges Bidirectional -- Equality-based analysis between variable nodes . When this option is set to true , all edges connecting variable ( Green ) nodes are made bidirectional , as in Steensgaard 's analysis .
32893	Enable or disabled the values storage . It is enabled by default , and can be disable in order to be able to perform performance benchmarks or tests with a huge amount values .
32898	Insert Redundant Casts -- . Insert extra casts for the Java bytecode verifier . The verifier may complain if the inlined method uses this and the declared type of the receiver of the call being inlined is different from the type implementing the target method being inlined . Say , for example , that Singer is an interface declaring the sing ( ) method and that the call graph shows that all receiver objects at a particular call site , singer.sing ( ) ( with singer declared as a Singer ) are in fact Bird objects ( Bird being a class that implements Singer ) . The implementation of Bird.sing ( ) may perform operations on this which are only allowed on Birds , rather than Singers . The Insert Redundant Casts option ensures that this can not lead to verification errors , by inserting a cast of bird to the Bird type before inlining the body of Bird.sing ( ) .
32900	Generate a random ID . It depends on the application nature and purpose that different strategies can be used . E.g . single threaded -- > current milliseconds since epoch UUID and hash can also be feasible in certain cases
32907	Return < tt > true < /tt > if the integer argument includes the < tt > PARTIAL_UPDATE < /tt > modifier , < tt > false < /tt > otherwise .
32911	For security , we only allow system package to be a browser customizations provider . However , requiring root and installing system apk makes testing harder , so we decided to have this hack for testing . This must not be called other than tests .
32926	A deep copy makes a distinct copy of each of the object 's fields , recursing through the entire graph of other objects referenced by the object being copied . Deep clone by serialize and deserialize the object and return the deserialized version . A deep copy/clone , assuming everything in the tree is serializable . NOTE : This method is very expensive ! , do n't use this method if you need performance .

Double check your manual switching to avoid weird side effects . < /p >
32974	Make a JSON text of this JSONArray . For compactness , no unnecessary whitespace is added . If it is not possible to produce a syntactically correct JSON text then null will be returned instead . This could occur if the array contains an invalid number . < p > Warning : This method assumes that the data structure is acyclical .
32984	( Optional ) Sets the cluster name used internally by the hector library . Use this if you plan to connect to more than one cassandra cluster in the same JVM .

33093	Detect if the root cause of the exception is a specific OrientDB exception This is necessary as the database may wrap this root cause in further exceptions , masking the underlying cause
33107	Retrieves the next attribute in this < code > SQLInputImpl < /code > object as a < code > float < /code > in the Java programming language . < P > This method does not perform type-safe checking to determine if the returned type is the expected type ; this responsibility is delegated to the UDT mapping as defined by a < code > SQLData < /code > implementation . < P >
33119	Creates and returns an enumeration that traverses the subtree rooted at this node in postorder . The first node returned by the enumeration 's < code > nextElement ( ) < /code > method is the leftmost leaf . This is the same as a depth-first traversal. < P > Modifying the tree by inserting , removing , or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification .

The parameters < code > orgName < /code > , < code > groupName < /code > and < code > serviceComponent < /code > denotes the organization name , configuration grouping name and service 's sub-component that are changed respectively .
33168	Convert to a formatted string for pretty printing . Note that the encode method converts this into a sip message that is suitable for transmission . Note hack here if you want to convert the nice curly brackets into some grotesque XML tag .
33188	Resolve an external entity . < p > Always return null , so that the parser will use the system identifier provided in the XML document . This method implements the SAX default behaviour : application writers can override it in a subclass to do special translations such as catalog lookups or URI redirection. < /p >
33189	Pops up a `` Save File '' file chooser dialog . Note that the text that appears in the approve button is determined by the L & amp ; F .
33191	Returns true if this pool allows core threads to time out and terminate if no tasks arrive within the keepAlive time , being replaced if needed when new tasks arrive . When true , the same keep-alive policy applying to non-core threads applies also to core threads . When false ( the default ) , core threads are never terminated due to lack of incoming tasks .
33194	Checks the disable replication subcommand options and updates the provided LocalizableMessageBuilder with the errors that were encountered with the subcommand options . This method assumes that the method parseArguments for the parser has already been called .
33199	Advances the current position to the next component . The operation returns true while the resulting current position indicates a component , false otherwise . A false return value leaves the current position at -1 . Invoking next on a DynAny without components leaves the current position at -1 and returns false .
33205	< p > Write the content of the message accumulated in the specified < code > StringBuffer < /code > to the appropriate output destination . The default implementation writes to < code > System.err < /code > . < /p >
33208	Decodes web safe Base64 content in byte array format and returns the decoded data . Web safe encoding uses '- ' instead of '+ ' , ' _ ' instead of '/ '
33218	Returns an encoder instance that encodes equivalently to this one , but without adding any padding character at the end of the encoded byte data . < p > The encoding scheme of this encoder instance is unaffected by this invocation . The returned encoder instance should be used for non-padding encoding operation .

To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class Size2DSyntax . < LI > This attribute 's X dimension is equal to < CODE > object < /CODE > 's X dimension . < LI > This attribute 's Y dimension is equal to < CODE > object < /CODE > 's Y dimension . < /OL >
33284	Equivalent to & lt ; servlet & gt ; & lt ; servlet-name & gt ; & lt ; servlet-class & gt ; . In general it is better/faster to use the method that takes a Servlet as param - this one can be used if the servlet is not commonly used , and want to avoid loading all deps . ( for example : jsp servlet ) You can customize the returned servlet , ex : wrapper.addInitParameter ( `` name '' , `` value '' ) ;
33309	Returns true if the character at offset is navigable too . This is implemented in terms of < code > isLiteral < /code > , subclasses may wish to provide different behavior .
33311	Creates an unmodifiable GSSAPI SASL bind request of the provided request . < p > The returned bind request creates defensive copies of the password in order to maintain immutability .
33315	Starts the login process for the given < code > AuthContextLocal < /code > object identified by the index type and index name .

The locale specifies the user preferred locale setting .
33329	Calculate the requirements for the major axis . This is called by the superclass whenever the requirements need to be updated ( i.e . a preferenceChanged was messaged through this view ) . < p > This is implemented to provide the superclass behavior adjusted for multi-row table cells .
33331	Creates a copy of this compound name . Changes to the components of this compound name wo n't affect the new copy and vice versa . The clone and this compound name share the same syntax .
33340	Returns true if the value identified by path is currently viewable , which means it is either the root or all of its parents are expanded . Otherwise , this method returns false .
33343	Assigns an attribute to be part of the return attributes . When a return attribute is provided , the return results of the query will only populate the indicated return attributes . The default is for all attributes to be returned , unless the query constrains the results using this function .
33346	Converts the specified long value into its decimal string representation . The returned string is a concatenation of a minus sign if the number is negative and characters from ' 0 ' to ' 9 ' .
33350	Checks if the specified value can be put ( ie added ) in this < tt > TabularData < /tt > instance ( ie value is not null , its composite type is equal to row type , and its index is not already used ) , and returns the index calculated for this value . The index is a List , and not an array , so that an index.equals ( otherIndex ) call will actually compare contents , not just the objects references as is done for an array object .
33360	Receive notification of an unparsed entity declaration . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to keep track of the unparsed entities declared in a document. < /p >

33379	Compares this string to the specified < code > String < /code > . The result is < code > true < /code > if and only if the argument is not < code > null < /code > and is a < code > String < /code > object that represents the same sequence of characters as this object .
33380	Sets the current position to index . The current position is indexed 0 to n-1 , that is , index zero corresponds to the first component . The operation returns true if the resulting current position indicates a component of the DynAny and false if index indicates a position that does not correspond to a component . Calling seek with a negative index is legal . It sets the current position to -1 to indicate no component and returns false . Passing a non-negative index value for a DynAny that does not have a component at the corresponding position sets the current position to -1 and returns false .
33418	Try 's to reset the super class and reset this class for re-use , so that you do n't need to create a new serializer ( mostly for performance reasons ) .
33430	Decodes web safe Base64 content in byte array format and returns the decoded byte array . Web safe encoding uses '- ' instead of '+ ' , ' _ ' instead of '/ '
33441	Returns the start index of the subsequence captured by the given group during the previous match operation . < p > < a href= '' Pattern.html # cg '' > Capturing groups < /a > are indexed from left to right , starting at one . Group zero denotes the entire pattern , so the expression < i > m. < /i > < tt > start ( 0 ) < /tt > is equivalent to < i > m. < /i > < tt > start ( ) < /tt > . < /p >
33445	Determines if the user belongs to this instance of the < code > Subject < /code > object . For example , a Role implemenation would return < code > true < /code > if the user belongs the specified role ; < code > false < /code > otherwise .

33521	Returns a copy of this OffsetDateTime with the specified number of days added . < p > This method adds the specified amount to the days field incrementing the month and year fields as necessary to ensure the result remains valid . The result is only invalid if the maximum/minimum year is exceeded . < p > For example , 2008-12-31 plus one day would result in 2009-01-01 . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .
33526	Cancels this key . < p > If this key has not yet been cancelled then it is added to its selector 's cancelled-key set while synchronized on that set . < /p >

33540	Add a custom connection property to the set that will be passed to our JDBC driver . This < strong > MUST < /strong > be called before the first connection is retrieved ( along with all the other configuration property setters ) . Calls to this method after the connection pool has been initialized have no effect .
33552	Export the activatable remote object to the RMI runtime to make the object available to receive incoming calls . The object is exported on an anonymous port , if < code > port < /code > is zero . < p > During activation , this < code > exportObject < /code > method should be invoked explicitly by an `` activatable '' object , that does not extend the < code > Activatable < /code > class . There is no need for objects that do extend the < code > Activatable < /code > class to invoke this method directly because the object is exported during construction .
33555	Creates a new URL by adding the provided path to the end of this OpenAM server 's URL . e.g . Given the path `` GetHttpSession ? op=create '' , if this OpenAM server is deployed to https : //openam.example.com:8080/openam then the resulting URL will be https : //openam.example.com:8080/openam/GetHttpSession ? op=create

33653	Registers a content operator that will be called when the specified operator string is encountered during content processing . < br > If you register an operator , it is a very good idea to pass the call on to the existing registered operator ( returned by this call ) , otherwise you may inadvertently change the internal behavior of the processor .
33656	Sets the generator that will be used to create or load the world . < p > This may be null , in which case the `` natural '' generator for this environment will be used .
33665	Copy the keys and values from the source to this object . This will not copy the default values . This is meant to be used by going from a higher precedence object to a lower precedence object , so that if a key already exists , this method will not reset it .
33679	Returns a copy of the info with a new character that represents the positive sign . < p > The character used to represent a positive number may vary by culture . This method specifies the character to use .
33680	Returns true if this route tunnels HTTPS through an HTTP proxy . See < a href= '' http : //www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2817.txt '' > RFC 2817 , Section 5.2 < /a > .
33687	Non-javadoc , non-public methods Returns < code > true < /code > if the data store has successfully authenticated the identity with the provided credentials . In case the data store requires additional credentials , the list would be returned via the < code > IdRepoException < /code > exception .

33822	This method tries to extract a full ASF-header out of the given stream . < br > If no header could be extracted < code > null < /code > is returned . < br >
33848	Begin the scope of a prefix-URI Namespace mapping . < p > The information from this event is not necessary for normal Namespace processing : the SAX XML reader will automatically replace prefixes for element and attribute names when the http : //xml.org/sax/features/namespaces feature is true ( the default ) . < /p > < p > There are cases , however , when applications need to use prefixes in character data or in attribute values , where they can not safely be expanded automatically ; the start/endPrefixMapping event supplies the information to the application to expand prefixes in those contexts itself , if necessary. < /p > < p > Note that start/endPrefixMapping events are not guaranteed to be properly nested relative to each-other : all startPrefixMapping events will occur before the corresponding startElement event , and all endPrefixMapping events will occur after the corresponding endElement event , but their order is not guaranteed. < /p >
33862	Checks if the year is a leap year , according to the ISO proleptic calendar system rules . < p > This method applies the current rules for leap years across the whole time-line . In general , a year is a leap year if it is divisible by four without remainder . However , years divisible by 100 , are not leap years , with the exception of years divisible by 400 which are . < p > For example , 1904 is a leap year it is divisible by 4 . 1900 was not a leap year as it is divisible by 100 , however 2000 was a leap year as it is divisible by 400 . < p > The calculation is proleptic - applying the same rules into the far future and far past . This is historically inaccurate , but is correct for the ISO-8601 standard .
33885	Marks the stream as reset . This method will not change the stream state if : < ul > < li > The stream is already reset < /li > < li > The stream is already closed < /li >
33886	Create the right XObject based on the type of the object passed . This function can not make an XObject that exposes DOM Nodes , NodeLists , and NodeIterators to the XSLT stylesheet as node-sets .
33891	Execute a periodic task , such as reloading , etc . This method will be invoked inside the classloading context of this container . Unexpected throwables will be caught and logged .
33892	This method evaluates an URL userdn expression . Something like : ldap : ///suffix ? ? sub ? ( filter ) . It also searches for the client DN entry and saves it in the evaluation context for repeat evaluations that might come later in processing .
33893	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue . The returned array elements are in no particular order . < p > The returned array will be `` safe '' in that no references to it are maintained by this queue . ( In other words , this method must allocate a new array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array . < p > This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs .
33923	Converts the given number to its English alphabet lowercase string representation . E.g . 1 will be converted to `` a '' , 2 to `` b '' , ... , 27 to `` aa '' , and so on .
33930	Support for reporting bound property changes for boolean properties . This method can be called when a bound property has changed and it will send the appropriate PropertyChangeEvent to any registered PropertyChangeListeners .
33932	Returns the next live successor of p , or null if no such . Unlike other traversal methods , iterators need to handle both : - dequeued nodes ( p.next == p ) - ( possibly multiple ) interior removed nodes ( p.item == null )
33934	If true , clicking the selected button deselects it , leaving no button selected . If false , exactly one radio button shall be selected at all times . Only valid for radio buttons .
33942	Returns whether this job name attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class JobName . < LI > This job name attribute 's underlying string and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's underlying string are equal . < LI > This job name attribute 's locale and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's locale are equal . < /OL >
33962	< p > Prints debug and exception messages only when the debug state is either Debug.MESSAGE or Debug.ON . If the debug file is not accessible and debugging is enabled , the message along with a time stamp and thread info will be printed on < code > System.out < /code > . < /p > < p > This method creates the debug file if does not exist ; otherwise it starts appending to the existing debug file . When invoked for the first time on this object , the method writes a line delimiter of '*'s. < /p > < p > Note that the debug file will remain open until < code > destroy ( ) < /code > is invoked . To conserve file resources , you should invoke < code > destroy ( ) < /code > explicitly rather than wait for the garbage collector to clean up. < /p > < p > < b > NOTE : < /b > Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused . Particularly , note that Java evaluates arguments to < code > message ( ) < /code > even when debugging is turned off . It is recommended that the debug state be checked by invoking < code > messageEnabled ( ) < /code > before invoking any < code > message ( ) < /code > methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and to maximize application performance. < /p >
33967	Embed basic patterns . On success , modify the matrix . The basic patterns are : - Position detection patterns - Timing patterns - Dark dot at the left bottom corner - Position adjustment patterns , if need be
33984	Add a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list . The listener is registered for all properties . The same listener object may be added more than once , and will be called as many times as it is added . If < code > listener < /code > is null , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .
33986	Perform a pre-order traversal non-recursive style . Note that TreeWalker assumes that the subtree is intended to represent a complete ( though not necessarily well-formed ) document and , during a traversal , startDocument and endDocument will always be issued to the SAX listener .
33989	Lays out the specified container using this grid bag layout . This method reshapes components in the specified container in order to satisfy the constraints of this < code > GridBagLayout < /code > object . < p > Most applications do not call this method directly .
33992	Pops the directory node that is the current top of the stack so that there are no more events for the directory ( including no END_DIRECTORY ) event . This method is a no-op if the stack is empty or the walker is closed .
33994	Reports a translation error if names specified in attributes of directives are not unique in this translation unit . The value of the following attributes must be unique . 1 . 'name ' attribute of an attribute directive 2 . 'name-given ' attribute of a variable directive 3 . 'alias ' attribute of variable directive 4 . 'dynamic-attributes ' of a tag directive except that 'dynamic-attributes ' can ( and must ) have the same value when it appears in multiple tag directives . Also , 'name-from ' attribute of a variable directive can not have the same value as that from another variable directive .
33995	Checks if the keytab file exists . Implementation of this method should make sure that the result matches the latest status of the keytab file . < p > The caller can use the result to determine if it should fallback to another mechanism to read the keys .
34001	Returns < code > true < /code > if the given < code > Object < /code > is an < code > ImageTypeSpecifier < /code > and has a < code > SampleModel < /code > and < code > ColorModel < /code > that are equal to those of this object .
34015	Searches for assignable dynamic groups in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of dynamic groups with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
34016	Writes an < code > Array < /code > object in the Java programming language to this < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > object . The driver converts this value to a serializable < code > SerialArray < /code > SQL < code > ARRAY < /code > value before returning it to the database .
34023	Removes the item at the specified position from this scrolling list . If the item with the specified position is selected , and is the only selected item in the list , the list is set to have no selection .
34030	Handles the new trusted partner request . There is no real processing done here . We are just forwarding the request onto the view bean which will do the real work .
34032	Requirements changed along the major axis . This is called by the thread doing layout for the given ChildState object when it has completed fetching the child views new preferences . Typically this would be the layout thread , but might be the event thread if it is trying to update something immediately ( such as to perform a model/view translation ) . < p > This is implemented to mark the major axis as having changed so that a future check to see if the requirements need to be published to the parent view will consider the major axis . If the span along the major axis is not estimated , it is updated by the given delta to reflect the incremental change . The delta is ignored if the major span is estimated .
34051	Calls < code > dragExit < /code > on the registered < code > DropTargetListener < /code > and passes it the specified < code > DropTargetEvent < /code > . Has no effect if this < code > DropTarget < /code > is not active . < p > This method itself does not throw any exception for null parameter but for exceptions thrown by the respective method of the listener .
34059	Receive notification of character data inside an element . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method to take specific actions for each chunk of character data ( such as adding the data to a node or buffer , or printing it to a file ) . < /p >
34094	Resets the schema registry to its original state ( creates a new one ) . Be careful this might break all existing XMPMeta-objects and should be used only for testing purpurses .
34117	Writes out start tags & lt ; u & gt ; , & lt ; i & gt ; , and & lt ; b & gt ; based on the mask settings .
34135	Looks ahead to see if there are optional spaces followed by the given String . If so , true is returned and those spaces and characters are skipped . If not , false is returned and the position is restored to where we were before .
34148	Reset the id field to the current value found in the native SSL_SESSION . It can change during the lifetime of the session because while a session is created during initial handshake , with handshake_cutthrough , the SSL_do_handshake may return before we have read the session ticket from the server side and therefore have computed no id based on the SHA of the ticket .
34155	< p > Updates the internal `` pressed '' state . If shouldActLikeButton ( ) is true , and if this method call will change the internal state , then the combo and button will be repainted. < /p > < p > Note that this method is called either when a press event occurs on the combo box , or on the arrow button. < /p >
34157	Retrieves the named object . If name is empty , returns a new instance of this context ( which represents the same naming context as this context , but its environment may be modified independently and it may be accessed concurrently ) .
34159	To generate new Star Brick ( which generates invincibility star ) element in stage . The generated element must be added into < b > SpriteHandler < /b > class 's < em > STAGE_ELEMENTS < /em > list and to the < em > stageContainer < /em > .

34180	Returns whether or not the supplied keyCode maps to a key that is used for navigation . This is used for optimizing key input by only passing non- navigation keys to the type-ahead mechanism . Subclasses should override this if they change the navigation keys .
34182	Returns the foo where uuid = & # 63 ; and groupId = & # 63 ; or returns < code > null < /code > if it could not be found . Uses the finder cache .
34186	Log a FINEST message , which is only to be constructed if the logging level is such that the message will actually be logged . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the FINEST message level then the message is constructed by invoking the provided supplier function and forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
34211	Returns true iff this MutableBigInteger is in normal form . A MutableBigInteger is in normal form if it has no leading zeros after the offset , and intLen + offset < = value.length .
34223	Clear the attribute list for reuse . < p > Note that little memory is freed by this call : the current array is kept so it can be reused. < /p >
34224	Log a message , with an array of object arguments . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the given message level then a corresponding LogRecord is created and forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
34225	Indicates that the JSON resource ID must be provided by the user , and will be used for naming the associated LDAP entry . More specifically , LDAP entry names will be derived by appending a single RDN to the collection 's base DN composed of the specified attribute type and LDAP value taken from the LDAP entry once attribute mapping has been performed . < p > Note that this naming policy requires that the user provides the resource name when creating new resources , which means it must be included in the resource content when not specified explicitly in the create request .
34227	< P > Determines whether the two object references are equivalent , so far as the ORB can easily determine . Two object references are equivalent if they are identical . Two distinct object references which in fact refer to the same object are also equivalent . However , ORBs are not required to attempt determination of whether two distinct object references refer to the same object , since such determination could be impractically expensive . < P > Default implementation of the org.omg.CORBA.Object method . < P >
34228	Polls this queue to see if a reference object is available . If one is available without further delay then it is removed from the queue and returned . Otherwise this method immediately returns < tt > null < /tt > .
34231	Checks if selection has begun ( are we out of slop ? ) . Note : DragState.mIsSelectionStarted goes back to false with the very next event . This is useful for starting Selection span on buffer .
34238	Computes the hash code of this address using its address type and contents . Two BinaryRefAddrs have the same hash code if they have the same address type and the same contents . It is also possible for different BinaryRefAddrs to have the same hash code .
34243	Closes ane open cdata tag , and unlike the this.endCDATA ( ) method ( from the LexicalHandler ) interface , this `` internal '' method will send the endCDATA ( ) call to the wrapped handler .
34255	Returns a String object representing this Attribute 's value . The format of this string is not specified , but users can expect that two Attributes return the same string if and only if they are equal .
34267	Sets the current position to index . The current position is indexed 0 to n-1 , that is , index zero corresponds to the first component . The operation returns true if the resulting current position indicates a component of the DynAny and false if index indicates a position that does not correspond to a component . Calling seek with a negative index is legal . It sets the current position to -1 to indicate no component and returns false . Passing a non-negative index value for a DynAny that does not have a component at the corresponding position sets the current position to -1 and returns false .
34269	Returns the encoded URL , rewritten to include the session id . cookie will be rewritten in the URL as a query string with entity escaping of ampersand before appending session id if other query parameters exists in the URL . < p >
34284	Returns < code > true < /code > if this < code > TextLayout < /code > has a left-to-right base direction or < code > false < /code > if it has a right-to-left base direction . The < code > TextLayout < /code > has a base direction of either left-to-right ( LTR ) or right-to-left ( RTL ) . The base direction is independent of the actual direction of text on the line , which may be either LTR , RTL , or mixed . Left-to-right layouts by default should position flush left . If the layout is on a tabbed line , the tabs run left to right , so that logically successive layouts position left to right . The opposite is true for RTL layouts . By default they should position flush left , and tabs run right-to-left .
34285	Load the class with the specified name . This method searches for classes in the same manner as < code > loadClass ( String , boolean ) < /code > with < code > false < /code > as the second argument .
34289	Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed , but will reuse previously constructed threads when they are available , and uses the provided ThreadFactory to create new threads when needed .
34296	Return a boolean indicating if the field named < code > name < /code > has been assigned a value explicitly ( false ) or if it still holds a default value for the type ( true ) because it has n't been assigned to yet .
34297	Encodes binary data using a URL-safe variation of the base64 algorithm but does not chunk the output . The url-safe variation emits - and _ instead of + and / characters . < b > Note : no padding is added. < /b >
34304	Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method to take specific actions for each chunk of ignorable whitespace ( such as adding data to a node or buffer , or printing it to a file ) . < /p >
34309	Tries to parse the authority component of this URI to divide it into the host , port , and user-info . If this URI is already determined as a ServerAuthority this instance will be returned without changes .
34314	Returns whether this media attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is of the same subclass of Media as this object . < LI > The values are equal . < /OL >
34315	Retrieve the value of the module ( cell ) pointed by `` x '' and `` y '' in the matrix of the QR Code . 1 represents a black cell , and 0 represents a white cell .
34320	< p > Are debug messages currently enabled ? < /p > < p > This allows expensive operations such as < code > String < /code > concatenation to be avoided when the message will be ignored by the logger . < /p >
34333	Actions to be taken when the left mouse button is pressed down . Default function to be overwritten in derived classes . Returns the return_state of this state , if the state is left after the method , or else this state .
34335	This after the template 's children have been composed . We have to get the count of how many variables have been declared , so we can do a link and unlink .
34338	Returns a string representation of this JApplet . This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes , and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations . The returned string may be empty but may not be < code > null < /code > .

34348	Gets whether to use vanilla ( false ) or exact behaviour ( true ) . < ul > < li > Vanilla behaviour : check for collisions and move the player if needed . < li > Exact behaviour : spawn players exactly where they should be . < /ul >
34362	Returns whether this requesting user name attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class RequestingUserName . < LI > This requesting user name attribute 's underlying string and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's underlying string are equal . < LI > This requesting user name attribute 's locale and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's locale are equal . < /OL >

34384	Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions , returning < tt > true < /tt > upon success and throwing an < tt > IllegalStateException < /tt > if no space is currently available . < p > This implementation returns < tt > true < /tt > if < tt > offer < /tt > succeeds , else throws an < tt > IllegalStateException < /tt > .
34391	Unregisters keyboard actions installed from < code > installKeyboardActions < /code > . This method is called at uninstallUI ( ) time - subclassess should ensure that all of the keyboard actions registered at installUI time are removed here .
34393	Specified that the character argument starts a single-line comment . All characters from the comment character to the end of the line are ignored by this stream tokenizer . < p > Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared .
34405	Queries the persistence layer using the given TokenFilter which must have the required 'return attributes ' defined within it . The results of this query then will be deleted from the store .
34420	Inserts all of the elements in the RoleList specified into this list , starting at the specified position , in the order in which they are returned by the Iterator of the RoleList specified .
34426	If the < code > realEditor < /code > will allow editing to stop , the < code > realEditor < /code > is removed and true is returned , otherwise false is returned .
34430	Copies the specified array , truncating or padding with zeros ( if necessary ) so the copy has the specified length . For all indices that are valid in both the original array and the copy , the two arrays will contain identical values . For any indices that are valid in the copy but not the original , the copy will contain < tt > ( byte ) 0 < /tt > . Such indices will exist if and only if the specified length is greater than that of the original array .
34431	Returns true if and only if < code > aNode < /code > is in the same tree as this node . Returns false if < code > aNode < /code > is null .
34432	Validate that provided cookie is coherent with this replication server , when ignoring the provided set of DNs . < p > The cookie is coherent if and only if it exactly has the set of DNs corresponding to the replication domains , and the states in the cookie are not older than oldest states in the server .

34437	Adds a < code > ChangeListener < /code > to the list that is notified each time the view 's size , position , or the viewport 's extent size has changed .
34441	Serializes the node value in XML encoding . Its used for tag bodies and attributes . < em > Note : < /em > The attribute is always limited by quotes , thats why < code > & amp ; apos ; < /code > is never serialized . < em > Note : < /em > Control chars are written unescaped , but if the user uses others than tab , LF and CR the resulting XML will become invalid .
34455	Returns < code > true < /code > if the primary type and the subtype of this object are the same as the specified < code > type < /code > ; otherwise returns < code > false < /code > .
34464	Compares this object to the specified object . The result is < code > true < /code > if and only if the argument is not < code > null < /code > and is an < code > UnknownTag < /code > object with the same name .
34472	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
34475	Compares two stubs for equality . Returns < code > true < /code > when used to compare stubs that represent the same remote object , and < code > false < /code > otherwise .
34476	Returns < code > true < /code > if signing is enabled ; otherwise , it will return false . If signing is enabled , all the liberty requests/responses must be signed/verfied .
34477	Starts the animation thread , creating and initializing it if necessary . This method is invoked when an indeterminate progress bar should start animating . Reasons for this may include : < ul > < li > The progress bar is determinate and becomes displayable < li > The progress bar is displayable and becomes determinate < li > The progress bar is displayable and determinate and this UI is installed < /ul > If you implement your own animation thread , you must override this method .
34492	Returns true since < code > Menu < /code > s , by definition , should always be on top of all other windows . If the menu is in an internal frame false is returned due to the rollover effect for windows laf where the menu is not always on top .
34493	Returns an iterator over all the elements ( both expired and unexpired ) in this queue . The iterator does not return the elements in any particular order . < p > The returned iterator is < a href= '' package-summary.html # Weakly '' > < i > weakly consistent < /i > < /a > .
34502	Creates and adds a JLabel representing the icon returned from < code > getIcon < /code > to < code > top < /code > . This is messaged from < code > createMessageArea < /code >
34505	Returns a < CODE > boolean < /CODE > value indicating whether the subpath must be closed or not . Ignore this value if the subpath is a rectangle because in this case it is already closed ( of course if you paint the path using < CODE > re < /CODE > operator )
34515	Creates a < code > LayoutManager < /code > that manages the < code > editor < /code > , < code > nextButton < /code > , and < code > previousButton < /code > children of the JSpinner . These three children must be added with a constraint that identifies their role : `` Editor '' , `` Next '' , and `` Previous '' . The default layout manager can handle the absence of any of these children .
34545	Adds a unicode locale attribute , if not already present , otherwise has no effect . The attribute must not be null and must be < a href= '' ./Locale.html # def_locale_extension '' > well-formed < /a > or an exception is thrown .
34549	Determines the minimum size of the < code > parent < /code > container using this grid bag layout . < p > Most applications do not call this method directly .
34565	Applies the provided modification to an entry . This method implements `` permissive '' modify semantics , ignoring attempts to add duplicate values or attempts to remove values which do not exist .
34574	Marks the stream as reset . This method will not change the stream state if : < ul > < li > The stream is already reset < /li > < li > The stream is already closed < /li > < /ul >
34581	Returns the foo where uuid = & # 63 ; and groupId = & # 63 ; or returns < code > null < /code > if it could not be found , optionally using the finder cache .
34591	Removes a node specified by local name and namespace URI . A removed attribute may be known to have a default value when this map contains the attributes attached to an element , as returned by the attributes attribute of the < code > Node < /code > interface . If so , an attribute immediately appears containing the default value as well as the corresponding namespace URI , local name , and prefix when applicable . < br > HTML-only DOM implementations do not need to implement this method .
34592	The < code > glassPane < /code > and < code > contentPane < /code > have the same bounds , which means < code > JRootPane < /code > does not tiles its children and this should return false . On the other hand , the < code > glassPane < /code > is normally not visible , and so this can return true if the < code > glassPane < /code > is n't visible . Therefore , the return value here depends upon the visibility of the < code > glassPane < /code > .
34593	Searches for sub group containers in this group container using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of group containers with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
34598	Returns the string representation of this exception . The string representation contains this exception 's class name , its detailed message , and if it has a root exception , the string representation of the root exception . This string representation is meant for debugging and not meant to be interpreted programmatically .

34602	Returns an appropriate capacity for the specified initial size . Does not round the result up to a power of two ; the caller must do this ! The returned value will be between 0 and MAXIMUM_CAPACITY ( inclusive ) .
34605	Receive notification of a parser warning . < p > The default implementation does nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each warning , such as inserting the message in a log file or printing it to the console. < /p >
34611	Returns whether calls to < code > add < /code > and < code > setLayout < /code > are forwarded to the < code > contentPane < /code > .
34621	Adds a column to the model . The new column will have the identifier < code > columnName < /code > , which may be null . This method will send a < code > tableChanged < /code > notification message to all the listeners . This method is a cover for < code > addColumn ( Object , Vector ) < /code > which uses < code > null < /code > as the data vector .
34638	Returns the number of components of a DynAny . For a DynAny without components , it returns zero . The operation only counts the components at the top level . For example , if component_count is invoked on a DynStruct with a single member , the return value is 1 , irrespective of the type of the member . < UL > < LI > For sequences , the operation returns the current number of elements . < LI > For structures , exceptions , and value types , the operation returns the number of members . < LI > For arrays , the operation returns the number of elements . < LI > For unions , the operation returns 2 if the discriminator indicates that a named member is active , otherwise , it returns 1 . < LI > For DynFixed and DynEnum , the operation returns zero . < /UL >
34647	Reads a byte from the compressed input stream . The result will be a byte of compressed data corresponding to an uncompressed byte or bytes read from the underlying stream .
34654	Calls to < code > revalidate < /code > that come from within the textfield itself will be handled by validating the textfield , unless the textfield is contained within a < code > JViewport < /code > , in which case this returns false .

34807	if this field is used with ID3v24 then it is usual to null separate values . Within ID3v23 not many frames officially support mutiple values , so in absense of better solution we use the v24 method , however some frames such as TCON have there own method and should not null separate values . This can be controlled by this field .
34815	Based on user research , these are the types of data dependencies that have meaning . Values produced are generally not `` terminal '' in this sense , because they come from other data .

35096	Retrieves the next attribute in this < code > SQLInputImpl < /code > object as a < code > long < /code > in the Java programming language . < P > This method does not perform type-safe checking to determine if the returned type is the expected type ; this responsibility is delegated to the UDT mapping as defined by a < code > SQLData < /code > implementation . < P >
35100	Causes subcomponents of this < code > JInternalFrame < /code > to be laid out at their preferred size . Internal frames that are iconized or maximized are first restored and then packed . If the internal frame is unable to be restored its state is not changed and will not be packed .
35103	Updates 'longCount ' by inspecting 'bits ' . Assumes that the new longCount is < = the current longCount , to avoid scanning large tracts of empty array . This means it 's safe to call directly after a clear operation that may have cleared the highest set bit , but not safe after an xor operation that may have cleared the highest set bit or made a new highest set bit . In that case , you 'd need to set 'longCount ' to a conservative estimate before calling this method .
35117	Releases a given key . < p > Key codes that have more than one physical key associated with them ( e.g . < code > KeyEvent.VK_SHIFT < /code > could mean either the left or right shift key ) will map to the left key .

The marshalling of an attribute will be done by < ol > < li > call the startAttribute method < li > call the text method ( several times if necessary ) < li > call the endAttribute method < /ol > No two attributes can be marshalled at the same time . Note that the whole attribute marshalling must be happened after the startElement method and before the endAttributes method .
35126	Called as the cursor 's hotspot moves over a platform-dependent drop site . This method is invoked when all the following conditions are true : < UL > < LI > The cursor 's hotspot has moved , but still intersects the operable part of the drop site associated with the previous dragEnter ( ) invocation . < LI > The drop site is still active . < LI > The drop site accepts the drag . < /UL >
35129	Starts the LogSign as a separate thread and also sets the time interval with which it will run and also the time interval after which it will start for the first time .

35140	Check if the provided entry contains the provided object class . < p > This method uses the default schema for decoding the object class attribute values . < p > The provided object class must be recognized by the schema , otherwise the method returns false .
35154	Calculates the hash code of this BasicAttributes . < p > The hash code is computed by adding the hash code of the attributes of this object . If this BasicAttributes ignores case of its attribute IDs , one is added to the hash code . If a subclass overrides < tt > hashCode ( ) < /tt > , it should override < tt > equals ( ) < /tt > as well so that two < tt > Attributes < /tt > instances that are equal have the same hash code .
35162	Returns the number of capturing groups in this matcher 's pattern . < p > Group zero denotes the entire pattern by convention . It is not included in this count . < p > Any non-negative integer smaller than or equal to the value returned by this method is guaranteed to be a valid group index for this matcher . < /p >

35173	Copies all the mappings in the specified map to this map . These mappings will replace all mappings that this map had for any of the keys currently in the given map .
35190	Adds a waiting thread . This pool makes no attempt to match waiting threads with pool entries . It is the caller 's responsibility to check that there is no entry before adding a waiting thread .
35202	Removes a < code > PropertyChangeListener < /code > from the listener list . The < code > PropertyChangeListener < /code > to be removed was registered for all properties .
35204	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue . The returned array elements are in no particular order . < p > The returned array will be `` safe '' in that no references to it are maintained by this queue . ( In other words , this method must allocate a new array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array . < p > This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs .
35205	Add a VetoableChangeListener to the listener list . The listener is registered for all properties . The same listener object may be added more than once , and will be called as many times as it is added . If < code > listener < /code > is null , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .
35207	Returns true if < code > anEvent < /code > is < b > not < /b > a < code > MouseEvent < /code > . Otherwise , it returns true if the necessary number of clicks have occurred , and returns false otherwise .
35213	This is the equivalent of calling Animator.start ( ) , except that it can be called when the animation is running in the opposite direction , in which case we reverse direction and animate for a correspondingly shorter duration .
35231	As of Java 2 platform v1.3 this method is no longer used . Subclassers previously using this method should instead create an Action wrapping the ActionListener , and register that Action by overriding < code > installKeyboardActions < /code > and placing the Action in the SplitPane 's ActionMap . Please refer to the key bindings specification for further details . < p > Creates a ActionListener for the JSplitPane UI that listens for specific key presses .
35239	This method simply calls < tt > put ( ( CompositeData ) value ) < /tt > and therefore ignores its < var > key < /var > parameter which can be < tt > null < /tt > .
35245	Returns an unmodifiable view of the specified collection . This method allows modules to provide users with `` read-only '' access to internal collections . Query operations on the returned collection `` read through '' to the specified collection , and attempts to modify the returned collection , whether direct or via its iterator , result in an < tt > UnsupportedOperationException < /tt > . < p > The returned collection does < i > not < /i > pass the hashCode and equals operations through to the backing collection , but relies on < tt > Object < /tt > 's < tt > equals < /tt > and < tt > hashCode < /tt > methods . This is necessary to preserve the contracts of these operations in the case that the backing collection is a set or a list. < p > The returned collection will be serializable if the specified collection is serializable .
35247	Returns a cached instance of < code > AWTKeyStroke < /code > ( or a subclass of < code > AWTKeyStroke < /code > ) which is equal to this instance .

Properties whose key or value is not of type < tt > String < /tt > are omitted . < p > The returned set is not backed by the < tt > Properties < /tt > object . Changes to this < tt > Properties < /tt > are not reflected in the set , or vice versa .
35272	Returns a pool that adaptively decreases its size when idle objects are no longer needed . This is intended as an always thread-safe alternative to using an idle object evictor provided by many pool implementations . This is also an effective way to shrink FIFO ordered pools that experience load spikes .

35313	Indicates that a child has changed its layout related information , and thus any cached calculations should be flushed . < p > This method is called by AWT when the invalidate method is called on the Container . Since the invalidate method may be called asynchronously to the event thread , this method may be called asynchronously .
35315	Adds a < code > Referral < /code > object to the this instance of user collection . Since the name is not provided it will be dynamically assigned such that it is unique within this instance of the user collection . However if a referral entry with the same name already exists in the user collection < code > NameAlreadyExistsException < /code > will be thrown .
35340	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
35346	SiteMinder invokes this method during shutdown so the authentication scheme can perform its own rundown procedure . This method is invoked once for each authentication scheme instance during SiteMinder shutdown .
35347	Visits the end of the class . This method , which is the last one to be called , is used to inform the visitor that all the fields and methods of the class have been visited .
35357	Processes events on this text component . If the event is a < code > TextEvent < /code > , it invokes the < code > processTextEvent < /code > method else it invokes its superclass 's < code > processEvent < /code > . < p > Note that if the event parameter is < code > null < /code > the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception .
35364	Writes an array of < code > bytes < /code > in the Java programming language to this < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > object . The driver converts it to an SQL < code > VARBINARY < /code > or < code > LONGVARBINARY < /code > before returning it to the database .

35386	Searches for group containers in this organizational unit using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of group containers with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
35399	This version of decode honors the intent of Reader.decode ( BinaryBitmap ) in that it passes null as a hint to the decoders . However , that makes it inefficient to call repeatedly . Use setHints ( ) followed by decodeWithState ( ) for continuous scan applications .
35400	Creates a new single-valued attribute with the specified attribute name and attribute value . < p > If the attribute name can not be found in the schema , a new attribute type is created using the default attribute syntax .

35424	Main execution method for delayed or periodic tasks . If pool is shut down , rejects the task . Otherwise adds task to queue and starts a thread , if necessary , to run it . ( We can not prestart the thread to run the task because the task ( probably ) should n't be run yet . ) If the pool is shut down while the task is being added , cancel and remove it if required by state and run-after-shutdown parameters .
35441	Read a single character . This method will block until a character is available , an I/O error occurs , or the end of the stream is reached . < p > Subclasses that intend to support efficient single-character input should override this method .

The following steps are taken until an input method has been selected : < ul > < li > If the currently selected input method or keyboard layout supports the requested locale , it remains selected. < /li > < li > If there is no input method or keyboard layout available that supports the requested locale , the current input method or keyboard layout remains selected. < /li > < li > If the user has previously selected an input method or keyboard layout for the requested locale from the user interface , then the most recently selected such input method or keyboard layout is reselected. < /li > < li > Otherwise , an input method or keyboard layout that supports the requested locale is selected in an implementation dependent way. < /li > < /ul > Before switching away from an input method , any currently uncommitted text is committed . If no input method or keyboard layout supporting the requested locale is available , then false is returned . < p > Not all host operating systems provide API to determine the locale of the currently selected native input method or keyboard layout , and to select a native input method or keyboard layout by locale . For host operating systems that do n't provide such API , < code > selectInputMethod < /code > assumes that native input methods or keyboard layouts provided by the host operating system support only the system 's default locale . < p > A text editing component may call this method , for example , when the user changes the insertion point , so that the user can immediately continue typing in the language of the surrounding text .
35534	Removes multiple instances of an ingredient from the list . If there are less instances then specified , all will be removed . Only removes exact matches , with a data value of 0 .
35553	Enter a traced zone by the name of metricReference for the specified thread . This puts the enter timestamp and all lost call calculations will be based on this timestamp .
35559	Converts an Integer to a Long for bucketing purposes . Order of integers will be preserved as longs , but not the actual numeric value . This method should < b > only < /b > be used for determining bucket placement .
35573	Adds a < code > PropertyChangeListener < /code > to the listener list . The listener is registered for all properties . < p > A < code > PropertyChangeEvent < /code > will get fired in response to an explicit call to < code > setFont < /code > , < code > setBackground < /code > , or < code > setForeground < /code > on the current component . Note that if the current component is inheriting its foreground , background , or font from its container , then no event will be fired in response to a change in the inherited property .
35579	Prints warning messages only when debug level is greater than Debug.ERROR . < p/ > < p > < b > NOTE : < /b > Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused . Particularly , note that Java evaluates arguments to < code > warning ( ) < /code > even when debugging is turned off . So when the argument to this method involves the String concatenation operator '+ ' or any other method invocation , < code > warningEnabled < /code > < b > MUST < /b > be used . It is recommended that the debug state be checked by invoking < code > warningEnabled ( ) < /code > before invoking any < code > warning ( ) < /code > methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and to maximize application performance . < /p >
35587	Returns Response object based on the XML document received from server . This method is used primarily at the client side . The schema of the XML document is describe above .
35597	Modify conflicts are solved for all suffixes but the schema suffix because we do n't want to store extra information in the schema ldif files . This has no negative impact because the changes on schema should not produce conflicts .

35668	Performs a blocking read using the bytebuffer for data to be read and a selector to block . If the < code > selector < /code > parameter is null , then it will perform a busy read that could take up a lot of CPU cycles .
35672	Method childValue is visibly defined in subclass InheritableThreadLocal , but is internally defined here for the sake of providing createInheritedMap factory method without needing to subclass the map class in InheritableThreadLocal . This technique is preferable to the alternative of embedding instanceof tests in methods .
35673	Called to notify the client that no more events will be delivered . One cause of this event being generated is if the job has successfully completed , but the printing system is limited in capability and can not verify this . This event is required to be delivered if none of the other terminal events ( completed/failed/canceled ) are delivered .
35677	Enable back the domain after a previous disable . The domain will connect back to a replication Server and will recreate threads to listen for messages from the Synchronization server . The generationId will be retrieved or computed if necessary . The ServerState will also be read again from the local database .

35723	Scans the next token of the input as a < tt > short < /tt > . < p > An invocation of this method of the form < tt > nextShort ( ) < /tt > behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation < tt > nextShort ( radix ) < /tt > , where < code > radix < /code > is the default radix of this scanner .
35725	Creates an invisible `` glue '' component that can be useful in a Box whose visible components have a maximum width ( for a horizontal box ) or height ( for a vertical box ) . You can think of the glue component as being a gooey substance that expands as much as necessary to fill the space between its neighboring components . < p > For example , suppose you have a horizontal box that contains two fixed-size components . If the box gets extra space , the fixed-size components wo n't become larger , so where does the extra space go ? Without glue , the extra space goes to the right of the second component . If you put glue between the fixed-size components , then the extra space goes there . If you put glue before the first fixed-size component , the extra space goes there , and the fixed-size components are shoved against the right edge of the box . If you put glue before the first fixed-size component and after the second fixed-size component , the fixed-size components are centered in the box . < p > To use glue , call < code > Box.createGlue < /code > and add the returned component to a container . The glue component has no minimum or preferred size , so it takes no space unless excess space is available . If excess space is available , then the glue component takes its share of available horizontal or vertical space , just like any other component that has no maximum width or height .
35734	Reads an unsigned 8-bit byte from the current position in this file and returns it as an integer . Blocks until one byte has been read , the end of the file is reached or an exception is thrown .

35776	Informs the system that the object with the corresponding activation < code > id < /code > is currently inactive . If the object is currently active , the object is `` unexported '' from the RMI runtime ( only if there are no pending or in-progress calls ) so the that it can no longer receive incoming calls . This call informs this VM 's ActivationGroup that the object is inactive , that , in turn , informs its ActivationMonitor . If this call completes successfully , a subsequent activate request to the activator will cause the object to reactivate . The operation may still succeed if the object is considered active but has already unexported itself .
35782	This method gets called when a bound property is changed on the associated JTextComponent . This is a hook which UI implementations may change to reflect how the UI displays bound properties of JTextComponent subclasses .

35792	Enables or disables input method support for this text component . If input method support is enabled and the text component also processes key events , incoming events are offered to the current input method and will only be processed by the component or dispatched to its listeners if the input method does not consume them . Whether and how input method support for this text component is enabled or disabled by default is implementation dependent .
35795	Notifies listeners of a property change . This is subclassed to update the < code > windowBlit < /code > property . ( The < code > putClientProperty < /code > property is final ) .

36237	Serializes this < code > DragSource < /code > . This method first performs default serialization . Next , it writes out this object 's < code > FlavorMap < /code > if and only if it can be serialized . If not , < code > null < /code > is written instead . Next , it writes out < code > Serializable < /code > listeners registered with this object . Listeners are written in a < code > null < /code > -terminated sequence of 0 or more pairs . The pair consists of a < code > String < /code > and an < code > Object < /code > ; the < code > String < /code > indicates the type of the < code > Object < /code > and is one of the following : < ul > < li > < code > dragSourceListenerK < /code > indicating a < code > DragSourceListener < /code > object ; < li > < code > dragSourceMotionListenerK < /code > indicating a < code > DragSourceMotionListener < /code > object . < /ul >
36255	Simply copies a chunk from < code > source < /code > to < code > destination < /code > . < br > The method assumes , that the GUID has already been read and will write the provided one to the destination. < br > The chunk length however will be read and used to determine the amount of bytes to copy .

36345	Helper method used to ensure that we do not use back-reference values that would produce illegal byte sequences ( ones with byte 0xFE or 0xFF ) . Note that we do not try to avoid null byte ( 0x00 ) by default , although it would be technically possible as well .
36348	Checks if two subsequent characters in a String are are the higher and the lower character in a surrogate pair ( and therefore eligible for conversion to a UTF 32 character ) .
36349	Removes the user-defined time formatter from this time thread so that it will no longer be maintained . This is a safe operation because if the same format string is used for multiple purposes then it will be added back the next time a time is requested with the given format .
36350	Inserts a row at < code > row < /code > in the model . The new row will contain < code > null < /code > values unless < code > rowData < /code > is specified . Notification of the row being added will be generated .
36362	Writes a message to the access logger with information about the search request associated with the provided search operation . < p > The default implementation is to not log anything .
36363	Returns a string representation of this < code > JSeparator < /code > . This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes , and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations . The returned string may be empty but may not be < code > null < /code > .
36375	This method should be used to check the interrupt status before attempting a write . If a thread has been interrupted and the interrupt has not been cleared then an attempt to write to the socket will fail . When this happens the socket is removed from the poller without the socket being selected . This results in a connection limit leak for NIO as the endpoint expects the socket to be selected even in error conditions .
36379	Same as < code > eval ( Reader , Bindings ) < /code > except that the abstract < code > eval ( String , ScriptContext ) < /code > is used .
36400	Returns < code > true < /code > if the specified < code > Object < /code > is a < code > TextLayout < /code > object and if the specified < code > Object < /code > equals this < code > TextLayout < /code > .
36413	Replaces an existing referral object having the same name with the new one . If a < code > Referral < /code > with the given name does not exist , < code > NameNotFoundException < /code > will be thrown .
36417	Notification from the < code > UIManager < /code > that the L & amp ; F has changed . Replaces the current UI object with the latest version from the < code > UIManager < /code > .
36420	See the general contract of the < code > readUnsignedByte < /code > method of < code > DataInput < /code > . < p > Bytes for this operation are read from the contained input stream .
36421	Process a Resource annotation to set up a Resource . Ref JSR 250 , equivalent to the resource-ref , message-destination-ref , env-ref , resource-env-ref or service-ref element in the deployment descriptor .
36423	This is is a utility method that helps event handlers figure out where to send the focus when the popup is brought up . The standard implementation delegates the focus to the editor ( if the combo box is editable ) or to the JComboBox if it is not editable .
36426	This method converts the Timepoint value to its corresponding long value , this method assumes that the date format is the same as the format being returned by the ParseUtils.parseStringAsDate . Note : Any value prior to Y2K ( 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 2000 ) will be bucketed as 0 and any value after 2030 will be bucketed as bucket max . This is done to reduce the number of buckets that are required for this type ( by eliminating ranges that are likely to be entirely unused ) .
36435	Returns a set of the keys contained in this map . The set is backed by this map so changes to one are reflected by the other . The set does not support adding .
36439	Fires a property change of a boolean property with the given name . If the old value and the new value are not null and equal the event will not be fired .
36464	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a character array using the specified character encoding . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
36471	Assigns the specified byte value to each element of the specified range of the specified array of bytes . The range to be filled extends from index < tt > fromIndex < /tt > , inclusive , to index < tt > toIndex < /tt > , exclusive . ( If < tt > fromIndex==toIndex < /tt > , the range to be filled is empty . )
36477	Establishes the default bindings of < code > type < /code > to < code > classname < /code > . The class will be dynamically loaded later when actually needed using the given < code > ClassLoader < /code > , and can be safely changed before attempted uses to avoid loading unwanted classes .
36483	may not work on KitKat due to lack of implementation of openFileChooser ( ) or onShowFileChooser ( ) https : //code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail ? id=62220 however newer versions of KitKat fixed it on some devices
36486	Composes the name of this context with a name relative to this context . < p > Given a name ( name ) relative to this context , and the name ( prefix ) of this context relative to one of its ancestors , this method returns the composition of the two names using the syntax appropriate for the naming system ( s ) involved . That is , if name names an object relative to this context , the result is the name of the same object , but relative to the ancestor context . None of the names may be null .
36510	Returns a Collection view of the values contained in this Cache . The Collection is backed by the Cache , so changes to the Cache are reflected in the Collection , and vice-versa . The Collection supports element removal ( which removes the corresponding entry from the Cache ) , but not element addition .
36512	Sets the < code > serviceName < /code > as the < code > wsam : ServiceName < /code > element in the < code > wsa : Metadata < /code > element . See < a href= '' http : //www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-ws-addr-metadata-20070904/ # refmetadatfromepr '' > 2.1 Referencing WSDL Metadata from an EPR < /a > for more details .
36531	Tests if there are more tokens available from this tokenizer 's string . If this method returns < tt > true < /tt > , then a subsequent call to < tt > nextToken < /tt > with no argument will successfully return a token .
36538	Reads a line of text . A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ( '\n ' ) , a carriage return ( '\r ' ) , or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed .
36550	Pushes back a single character by copying it to the front of the pushback buffer . After this method returns , the next character to be read will have the value < code > ( char ) c < /code > .
36558	< strong > ANDROID INTERPOLATOR < /strong > < br/ > < br/ > Create an Interpolator for a cubic Bezier curve . The end points ( 0 , 0 ) and ( 1 , 1 ) are assumed .
36562	Returns the < code > IOException < /code > last thrown by this < code > Scanner < /code > 's underlying < code > Readable < /code > . This method returns < code > null < /code > if no such exception exists .
36570	This method is now obsolete , please use a combination of < code > getActionMap ( ) < /code > and < code > getInputMap ( ) < /code > for similar behavior .
36574	Determines whether the desired Attribute NameFormat matches with the available attribute 's NameFormat . When the NameFormat is n't specified in the request , the < code > urn : oasis : names : tc : SAML:2.0 : attrname-format : unspecified < /code > default NameFormat needs to be used ( see SAML core spec 2.7.3.1 ) . The different attribute profiles ( SAML profiles spec section 8 ) each determine how the attribute comparison should be performed , however there is no clear way to actually determine which attribute profile is being used when the Attribute Authority supports more than one profile . Because of this , the unspecified Attribute NameFormat has been implemented as a wildcard match , much similarly to how requesting the unspecified NameID-Format allows the IdP to choose an arbitrary NameID-Format when generating the assertion for an SP .
36577	Returns the number of components of a DynAny . For a DynAny without components , it returns zero . The operation only counts the components at the top level . For example , if component_count is invoked on a DynStruct with a single member , the return value is 1 , irrespective of the type of the member . < UL > < LI > For sequences , the operation returns the current number of elements . < LI > For structures , exceptions , and value types , the operation returns the number of members . < LI > For arrays , the operation returns the number of elements . < LI > For unions , the operation returns 2 if the discriminator indicates that a named member is active , otherwise , it returns 1 . < LI > For DynFixed and DynEnum , the operation returns zero . < /UL >
36587	Indicates whether errors should be ignored during the upgrade . < p > This option should be used with caution and may be useful in automated deployments where potential errors are known in advance and resolved after the upgrade has completed
36593	Gets whether you should show UI with rationale for requesting a permission . You should do this only if you do not have the permission and the context in which the permission is requested does not clearly communicate to the user what would be the benefit from granting this permission . < p > For example , if you write a camera app , requesting the camera permission would be expected by the user and no rationale for why it is requested is needed . If however , the app needs location for tagging photos then a non-tech savvy user may wonder how location is related to taking photos . In this case you may choose to show UI with rationale of requesting this permission . < /p >
36598	Applies the interpolator and length to the animator , such that the fling animation is consistent with the finger motion for the case when the animation is making something disappear .
36602	This method translates the request to an XML document String based on the Request schema described above . NOTE : this is a complete SAML request XML string with < code > RequestID < /code > , < code > MajorVersion < /code > , etc .
36610	Returns the response for the HTTP redirect or authorization challenge that triggered this response , or null if this response was n't triggered by an automatic retry . The body of the returned response should not be read because it has already been consumed by the redirecting client .
36627	A factory method used for the creation of new XML elements that can be added to this XML document at a later stage . When this method is called , a new < code > XMLElement < /code > object is returned to the caller . However , this newly created element is still not attached to the document anywhere and it is the responsiblity of the caller to attach it in the appropriate location .
36639	Visit a predicate within a location path . Note that there is n't a proper unique component for predicates , and that the expression will be called also for whatever type Expression is .
36652	Returns true if any of the < code > UndoableEdit < /code > s in < code > edits < /code > do . Returns false if they all return false .
36659	Overrides < code > JComponent.removeNotify < /code > to check if this button is currently set as the default button on the < code > RootPane < /code > , and if so , sets the < code > RootPane < /code > 's default button to < code > null < /code > to ensure the < code > RootPane < /code > does n't hold onto an invalid button reference .
36662	There is no need to register class in local process ! But if the returned type of a method is not exactly the same with the return type of the method , it should be registered .
36663	Decrements the count of in-flight transactions to the resource being monitored . < p/ > If this operation results in the counter falling below 0 - an exception is raised .
36667	Log a SEVERE message , which is only to be constructed if the logging level is such that the message will actually be logged . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the SEVERE message level then the message is constructed by invoking the provided supplier function and forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
36668	Returns true if this RepaintManager is double buffered . The default value for this property may vary from platform to platform . On platforms where native double buffering is supported in the AWT , the default value will be < code > false < /code > to avoid unnecessary buffering in Swing . On platforms where native double buffering is not supported , the default value will be < code > true < /code > .
36676	Returns the successor of p , or the head node if p.next has been linked to self , which will only be true if traversing with a stale pointer that is now off the list .
36677	Ensures all methods in the override structure have the same name . This is only needed for cases like : http : //pastebin.com/CpeD6wgN < br > TODO : Determine if this step is even needed for each input and ignore it if it 's not needed .
36681	Overridable callback method invoked to determine if a directory should be processed . < p > This method returns a boolean to indicate if the directory should be examined or not . If you return false , the entire directory and any subdirectories will be skipped . Note that this functionality is in addition to the filtering by file filter . < p > This implementation does nothing and returns true .
36690	Enable JDK logging to stderr at provided level for OpenDJ classes . < p > Error and warning messages will be printed on stderr , other messages will be printed on stdout .
36692	Sends a request to a SOAP endpoint and returns the response . The server only contains one servlet for different web services . So the SOAP endpoint URL has format 'servlet_URL/key ' .
36697	Returns < code > true < /code > ( the default ) if the < code > Timer < /code > will send an action event to its listeners multiple times .
36700	Receive notification of the end of an element . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the end of each element ( such as finalising a tree node or writing output to a file ) . < /p >
36710	Creates sunxmlkeyvalue files with the given values under the given directory . sunxmlkeyvalue files are created so searching for realms does not have to read in every attribute properrties file and look for the sunxmlkeyvalue attribute . we just need to look for sub directories with the sunxmlkeyvalue file .
36725	Reads a single character from this reader and returns it with the two higher-order bytes set to 0 . If possible , BufferedReader returns a character from the buffer . If there are no characters available in the buffer , it fills the buffer and then returns a character . It returns -1 if there are no more characters in the source reader .
36729	Check node to see if it was created by a DOM implementation that this helper is intended to support . This is currently disabled , and assumes all nodes are acceptable rather than checking that they implement org.apache.xerces.dom.NodeImpl .
36735	Performs a JAXRPC method call . The parameter < code > functionName < /code > is the JAXRPC function to be called with parameters < code > params < /code > . Returns an object on success , else throws an < code > Exception < /code > .
36740	Updates the status for an IndexCreatedEvent in the database . Take note : only a few getFields are updatable : numberOfRecordsCompleted , statusLastUpdatedAt , and error . This is a logical decision ; there should not be a reason to update any other getFields . This will also mark the record as done indexing or not as appropriate .
36760	Creates a new titled border with an empty title , the specified border object , the default text position ( determined by the current look and feel ) , the default justification ( leading ) , and the default font and text color ( determined by the current look and feel ) .
36762	Method called to see if a new value is expected for this Array or Object . Checks against expected length , if one known , updating count of current entries if limit not yet reached .
36773	Reads a single character from the source string and returns it as an integer with the two higher-order bytes set to 0 . Returns -1 if the end of the source string has been reached .
36774	Scrolls the associated view ( if necessary ) to make the caret visible . Since how this should be done is somewhat of a policy , this method can be reimplemented to change the behavior . By default the scrollRectToVisible method is called on the associated component .
36775	Retrieves the < code > TypeCode < /code > object that corresponds to the value held in this < code > ServiceInformationHolder < /code > object 's < code > value < /code > field .
36780	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
36786	Returns the instance of < code > JToolTip < /code > that should be used to display the tooltip . Components typically would not override this method , but it can be used to cause different tooltips to be displayed differently .
36801	Atomically updates the current value with the results of applying the given function to the current and given values , returning the updated value . The function should be side-effect-free , since it may be re-applied when attempted updates fail due to contention among threads . The function is applied with the current value as its first argument , and the given update as the second argument .
36808	Create a compact set of attributes that might be shared . This is a hook for subclasses that want to alter the behavior of SmallAttributeSet . This can be reimplemented to return an AttributeSet that provides some sort of attribute conversion .
36809	Starts the drag operation given the < code > Cursor < /code > for this drag operation and the < code > Transferable < /code > representing the source data for this drag operation . < br > If a < code > null < /code > < code > Cursor < /code > is specified no exception will be thrown and default drag cursors will be used instead . < br > If a < code > null < /code > < code > Transferable < /code > is specified < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown .
36811	Close the stream , flushing it first . Once a stream has been closed , further write ( ) or flush ( ) invocations will cause an IOException to be thrown . Closing a previously-closed stream , however , has no effect .
36812	Messages to stop the editing session . If the UI the receiver is providing the look and feel for returns true from < code > getInvokesStopCellEditing < /code > , stopCellEditing will invoked on the current editor . Then completeEditing will be messaged with false , true , false to cancel any lingering editing .
36823	Repositions this stream to the position at the time the < code > mark < /code > method was last called on this input stream . < p > This method simply performs < code > in.reset ( ) < /code > . < p > Stream marks are intended to be used in situations where you need to read ahead a little to see what 's in the stream . Often this is most easily done by invoking some general parser . If the stream is of the type handled by the parse , it just chugs along happily . If the stream is not of that type , the parser should toss an exception when it fails . If this happens within readlimit bytes , it allows the outer code to reset the stream and try another parser .
36835	This method gets called every time when a rollover column in the table header is updated . Every look and feel that supports a rollover effect in a table header should override this method and repaint the header .
36851	Push both the current xsl : template or xsl : for-each onto the stack , along with the child node that was matched . ( Note : should this only be used for xsl : templates ? ? -sb )
36865	Invalidates session for a specific protocol . This method invaldates the session if it is not used in any other federation protocol , otherwise modifies session property to remove the sepcified protocol from the session .
36867	Remove the object bound with the specified name from this session . If the session does not have an object bound with this name , this method does nothing . < p > After this method executes , and if the object implements < code > HttpSessionBindingListener < /code > , the container calls < code > valueUnbound ( ) < /code > on the object .
36868	Creates the DropTargetContext associated with this DropTarget . Subclasses may override this method to instantiate their own DropTargetContext subclass . This call is typically *only* called by the platform 's DropTargetContextPeer as a drag operation encounters this DropTarget . Accessing the Context while no Drag is current has undefined results .
36873	Resolves the relative or absolute pathname correctly in both Ant and command-line situations . If Ant launched us , we should use the basedir of the current project to resolve relative paths . See Bugzilla 35571 .
36883	Shows a question-message dialog requesting input from the user , with the input value initialized to < code > initialSelectionValue < /code > . The dialog uses the default frame , which usually means it is centered on the screen .
36904	Prints the stack trace of the root exception to a PrintWriter Also prints the messages of all the exceptions starting from top exception to the root exception , at the top of stack trace
36918	Throws an < code > org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT < /code > exception with the message `` This is a locally constrained object . '' This method is the default implementation of the < code > org.omg.CORBA.Object < /code > method. < P >
36922	Called when GCM tokens are available . If the callback is added to the helper with a STICKY request then it would be immediately triggered with the value of updated as false
36928	< p > Returns a string representation of this object . In general , the < code > toString < /code > method returns a string that `` textually represents '' this object . The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read. < /p >
36967	Writes the specified < code > byte < /code > to the piped output stream . < p > Implements the < code > write < /code > method of < code > OutputStream < /code > .
36982	Tests for equality between the specified identity and this identity . This method should be overriden by subclasses to test for equality . The default behavior is to return true if the names and public keys are equal .
36983	Finds the implementation Class object in the specified order . The specified order is the following : < ol > < li > query the system property using < code > System.getProperty < /code > < li > read < code > $ java.home/lib/ < i > propertiesFilename < /i > < /code > file < li > read < code > META-INF/services/ < i > factoryId < /i > < /code > file < li > use fallback classname < /ol >
36985	Removes an < code > ActionListener < /code > from the button . If the listener is the currently set < code > Action < /code > for the button , then the < code > Action < /code > is set to < code > null < /code > .
36990	Returns true if this scanner has another token in its input . This method may block while waiting for input to scan . The scanner does not advance past any input .
36992	SynchronizedRandomAccessList instances are serialized as SynchronizedList instances to allow them to be deserialized in pre-1.4 JREs ( which do not have SynchronizedRandomAccessList ) . This method inverts the transformation . As a beneficial side-effect , it also grafts the RandomAccess marker onto SynchronizedList instances that were serialized in pre-1.4 JREs . Note : Unfortunately , SynchronizedRandomAccessList instances serialized in 1.4.1 and deserialized in 1.4 will become SynchronizedList instances , as this method was missing in 1.4 .
36994	Returns a positive BigInteger that is probably prime , with the specified bitLength . The probability that a BigInteger returned by this method is composite does not exceed 2 < sup > -100 < /sup > .
36995	SiteMinder invokes this method so the authentication scheme can perform its own initialization procedure . This method is invoked once for each authentication scheme instance when it is first loaded .
36996	Advances the current position to the next component . The operation returns true while the resulting current position indicates a component , false otherwise . A false return value leaves the current position at -1 . Invoking next on a DynAny without components leaves the current position at -1 and returns false .
36999	Add a child to the child list . < ! ELEMENT xsl : apply-templates ( xsl : sort|xsl : with-param ) * > < ! ATTLIST xsl : apply-templates select % expr ; `` node ( ) '' mode % qname ; # IMPLIED >
37002	Static method to serialize the metadata object . For each serialisation , a new XMPSerializer instance is created , either XMPSerializerRDF or XMPSerializerPlain so thats its possible to serialialize the same XMPMeta objects in two threads .
37006	Receive notification of the end of the document . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the end of a document ( such as finalising a tree or closing an output file ) . < /p >
37007	See the general contract of the < code > readByte < /code > method of < code > DataInput < /code > . < p > Bytes for this operation are read from the contained input stream .
37009	Request the read lock . Block until a read operation can be performed safely . This call must be followed by a call to readDone ( ) when the read operation completes .
37019	Terminate the current line by writing the line separator string . The line separator string is defined by the system property < code > line.separator < /code > , and is not necessarily a single newline character ( < code > '\n ' < /code > ) . Need to change this from PrintWriter because the default println ( ) writes to the sink directly instead of through the write method ...
37022	This method is called back by SM when a service 's global configuration data has been changed . The parameter < code > groupName < /code > denote the name of the configuration grouping ( e.g . default ) and < code > componentName < /code > denotes the service 's sub-component that changed .
37033	Resizes the < code > TableColumn < /code > to fit the width of its header cell . This method does nothing if the header renderer is < code > null < /code > ( the default case ) . Otherwise , it sets the minimum , maximum and preferred widths of this column to the widths of the minimum , maximum and preferred sizes of the Component delivered by the header renderer . The transient `` width '' property of this TableColumn is also set to the preferred width . Note this method is not used internally by the table package .
37038	Converts Unix Time into Java Calendar time . Unix Time is a measure of seconds from the epoch . Therefore is devoid of any timezone information . The current default timezone will be assumed for this function .
37065	Returns the number of bytes currently being used to store the values in this cache . This may be greater than the max size if a background deletion is pending .
37068	Returns a PermissionCollection object for storing DelegationPermission objects . < br > DelegationPermission objects must be stored in a manner that allows them to be inserted into the collection in any order , but that also enables the PermissionCollection implies method to be implemented in an efficient ( and consistent ) manner .
37074	Returns true if the Region is a subregion of a Component , otherwise false . For example , < code > Region.BUTTON < /code > corresponds do a < code > Component < /code > so that < code > Region.BUTTON.isSubregion ( ) < /code > returns false .
37075	Parses a single command from the content . Each command is output as an array of arguments having the command itself as the last element . The returned array will be empty if the end of content was reached .
37081	Retrieves the next attribute in this < code > SQLInputImpl < /code > object as a < code > boolean < /code > in the Java programming language . < p > This method does not perform type-safe checking to determine if the returned type is the expected type ; this responsibility is delegated to the UDT mapping as defined by a < code > SQLData < /code > implementation . < p >
37083	Add a PropertyChangeListener for a specific property . The same listener object may be added more than once . For each property , the listener will be invoked the number of times it was added for that property . If < code > name < /code > or < code > pcl < /code > is null , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .
37086	Searches for organizational units in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of organizational units with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
37092	Forces this phaser to enter termination state . Counts of registered parties are unaffected . If this phaser is a member of a tiered set of phasers , then all of the phasers in the set are terminated . If this phaser is already terminated , this method has no effect . This method may be useful for coordinating recovery after one or more tasks encounter unexpected exceptions .
37105	Execute the specified command , based on the configured properties . The input stream will be closed upon completion of this task , whether it was executed successfully or not .
37114	Should return a shape ideal for painting based on the passed in Shape < code > a < /code > . This is useful if painting in a different region . The default implementation returns < code > a < /code > .
37115	Reads some number of bytes from the audio input stream and stores them into the buffer array < code > b < /code > . The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer . This method blocks until input data is available , the end of the stream is detected , or an exception is thrown . < p > This method will always read an integral number of frames . If the length of the array is not an integral number of frames , a maximum of < code > b.length - ( b.length % frameSize ) < /code > bytes will be read .
37118	As of Java 2 platform v1.3 this method is no longer used . Subclassers previously using this method should instead create an Action wrapping the ActionListener , and register that Action by overriding < code > installKeyboardActions < /code > and placing the Action in the SplitPane 's ActionMap . Please refer to the key bindings specification for further details . < p > Creates a ActionListener for the JSplitPane UI that listens for specific key presses .
37128	Calls < code > dropActionChanged < /code > on the registered < code > DropTargetListener < /code > and passes it the specified < code > DropTargetDragEvent < /code > . Has no effect if this < code > DropTarget < /code > is not active .
37129	This method is used primarily at the server side to reconstruct a < code > SessionRequest < /code > object based on the XML document received from client . The DTD of this XML document is described above .
37130	Generates the string representation of this attribute set . The string consists of each attribute identifier and the contents of each attribute . The contents of this string is useful for debugging and is not meant to be interpreted programmatically .
37138	Compares the specified object with this < code > AuthPrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns true if the given object is also an < code > AuthPrincipal < /code > and the two < code > AuthPrincipal < /code > s have the same user name .

If < code > listener < /code > was added more than once to the same event source for the specified property , it will be notified one less time after being removed . If < code > propertyName < /code > is null , no exception is thrown and no action is taken . If < code > listener < /code > is null , or was never added for the specified property , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .
37274	The string representation of this exception consists of information about where the error occurred , and the first unexecuted modification . This string is meant for debugging and not mean to be interpreted programmatically .
37275	Wrap a class name , loading it via a given class loader . < p > This is the same as calling < code > on ( Class.forName ( name , classLoader ) ) < /code >
37277	Sets the session id of the current login process . Must not be set on the start of a login process , i.e . the first authenticate request , and on subsequent requests must be set with the session id returned from the previous authentication request . Must NOT be used for a user 's current session , i.e . for session upgrade authentication requests .
37278	Paints the background of the window containing the tool bar when it has been detached from its primary frame . This implementation invokes the method of the same name without the orientation .
37283	Returns the size of this writer , that is the number of characters it stores . This number changes if this writer is reset or when more characters are written to it .
37284	Changes to a new int array to hold the pixels for this image . If the animation flag has been turned on through the setAnimated ( ) method , then the new pixels will be immediately delivered to any ImageConsumers that are currently interested in the data for this image .
37316	Returns a string representation of this < code > SimpleType < /code > instance . < p > The string representation consists of the name of this class ( ie < code > javax.management.openmbean.SimpleType < /code > ) and the type name for this instance ( which is the java class name of the values this < code > SimpleType < /code > instance represents ) . < p > As < code > SimpleType < /code > instances are immutable , the string representation for this instance is calculated once , on the first call to < code > toString < /code > , and then the same value is returned for subsequent calls .
37327	Determines whether the existing managed object can be deleted from the server 's configuration . For example , an implementation might enforce referential integrity by preventing referenced managed objects from being deleted . < p > If the constraint is not satisfied , the implementation must return < code > false < /code > and add a message describing why the managed object can not be deleted . < p > The default implementation is to return < code > true < /code > .
37329	Returns the collected javax.sip.ResponseEvent or null if no event has been collected . After this method is called the SipEventCollector will remove itself from the corresponding javax.sip.SipProvider and reset its internal state so that it could be reused .
37344	Tries to reduce the nets of traces and vias , so that the nets are a subset of the nets of the contact items . This is applied to traces and vias with more than 1 net connected to tie pins .
37352	< p > In the SAX delegation code , I 've inlined the count-down in the hope of encouraging compilers to deliver better performance . However , if we subclass ( eg to directly connect the output to a DTM builder ) , that would require calling super in order to run that logic ... which seems inelegant . Hence this routine for the convenience of subclasses : every [ frequency ] invocations , issue a co_yield. < /p >
37357	Tries to CAS newSucc as successor . To minimize races with unlink that may lose this index node , if the node being indexed is known to be deleted , it does n't try to link in .
37361	Escapes colons ( `` : '' ) in the supplied String to `` & # 58 ; '' . Useful mostly for the MBean names , as jdmk really does n't like them .

37442	Increments or decrements the specified field and wraps the value of the field when it goes beyond the maximum or minimum value for the current date . Other fields will be adjusted as required to maintain a consistent date . For example , March 31 will roll to April 30 when rolling the month field .
37452	Checks to see if the location we obtained is valid . GLES returns -1 if a label could not be found , but does not set the GL error . < p > Throws a RuntimeException if the location is invalid .
37457	Specifies the resource ID of the resource which is a super-type of this resource . This resource will inherit the properties and sub-resources of the super-type , and may optionally override them .
37459	Sets the properties on this textfield to match those in the specified < code > Action < /code > . Refer to < a href= '' Action.html # buttonActions '' > Swing Components Supporting < code > Action < /code > < /a > for more details as to which properties this sets .

37533	Understands how to resolve a Token based on its SessionID . Stateless Sessions by their very nature do not need to be stored in memory , and so can be resolved in a different way to Stateful Sessions .
37539	< p > Write the tag contained in this AudioFile in the actual file on the disk , this is the same as calling the < code > AudioFileIO.write ( this ) < /code > method .
37570	If this method returns true , < code > revalidate < /code > calls by descendants of this component will cause the entire tree beginning with this root to be validated . Returns false by default . < code > JScrollPane < /code > overrides this method and returns true .
37586	The preOperation phase for the add Operation . Its job is to generate the replication context associated to the operation . It is necessary to do it in this phase because contrary to the other operations , the entry UUID is not set when the handleConflict phase is called .
37588	Returns the number of components of a DynAny . For a DynAny without components , it returns zero . The operation only counts the components at the top level . For example , if component_count is invoked on a DynStruct with a single member , the return value is 1 , irrespective of the type of the member . < UL > < LI > For sequences , the operation returns the current number of elements . < LI > For structures , exceptions , and value types , the operation returns the number of members . < LI > For arrays , the operation returns the number of elements . < LI > For unions , the operation returns 2 if the discriminator indicates that a named member is active , otherwise , it returns 1 . < LI > For DynFixed and DynEnum , the operation returns zero . < /UL >
37603	Compares this < code > String < /code > to another < code > String < /code > , ignoring case considerations . Two strings are considered equal ignoring case if they are of the same length , and corresponding characters in the two strings are equal ignoring case .
37605	Load the class with the specified name . This method searches for classes in the same manner as < code > loadClass ( String , boolean ) < /code > with < code > false < /code > as the second argument .

37621	Returns < code > true < /code > if provider check must fail if the provider is not known by the WSP ( i.e . : if the WSP has not got the metadata of the WSC . )
37624	Enables smart mode . < p/ > In smart mode when resources ( such as fonts , images , ... ) are encountered , a reference to these resources is saved in a cache , so that they can be reused . This requires more memory , but reduces the file size of the resulting PDF document .
37630	Gets the cancellation state of this event . A cancelled event will not be executed in the server , but will still pass to other plugins . < p > If an inventory open event is cancelled , the inventory screen will not show .
37644	This field 's name `` only-if-cached '' is misleading . It actually means `` do not use the network '' . It is set by a client who only wants to make a request if it can be fully satisfied by the cache . Cached responses that would require validation ( ie . conditional gets ) are not permitted if this header is set .
37657	Simply copies a chunk from < code > source < /code > to < code > destination < /code > . < br > The method assumes , that the GUID has already been read and will write the provided one to the destination. < br > The chunk length however will be read and used to determine the amount of bytes to copy .
37658	Puts the value into Image XObject dictionary and associates it with the specified key . If the key is already present , it will override the old value with the specified one .
37682	Reset the stream . If the stream has been marked , then attempt to reposition it at the mark . If the stream has not been marked , then attempt to reset it in some way appropriate to the particular stream , for example by repositioning it to its starting point . Not all character-input streams support the reset ( ) operation , and some support reset ( ) without supporting mark ( ) .
37686	Invokes < code > provideErrorFeedback < /code > on the current look and feel , which typically initiates an error beep . The normal behavior of transferring the currently selected range in the associated text model to the system clipboard , and removing the contents from the model , is not acceptable for a password field .
37689	Registers the provided OID as a supported control for the Directory Server . This will have no effect if the specified control OID is already present in the list of supported controls .
37693	Register that we are expecting results from a call to the Facebook application ( e.g. , from a native dialog provided by the Facebook app ) . Activity results forwarded to onActivityResults will be parsed and handled if they correspond to this call . Only a single pending FacebookDialog call can be tracked at a time ; attempting to track another one will cancel the first one .
37698	Stops all the idle threads in the pool . Note that these stopped threads are no longer availble for future tasks because they are returned to underlying virtual machine . Also note that none of the active threads in the pool are stopped .
37706	Clear the contents of the buffer . If the buffer has been already been flushed then the clear operation shall throw an IOException to signal the fact that some data has already been irrevocably written to the client response stream .
37709	Sets the specified value with the specified key in the < code > ENGINE_SCOPE < /code > < code > Bindings < /code > of the protected < code > context < /code > field .
37710	< p > Return a new object implementing the MBeanServer interface with a standard default domain name . The default domain name is used as the domain part in the ObjectName of MBeans when the domain is specified by the user is null. < /p > < p > The standard default domain name is < code > DefaultDomain < /code > . < /p > < p > The MBeanServer reference is internally kept . This will allow < CODE > findMBeanServer < /CODE > to return a reference to this MBeanServer object. < /p > < p > This method is equivalent to < code > createMBeanServer ( null ) < /code > .
37713	Verify that the given attribute category object is equal to the category of the given attribute value object . If so , this method returns doing nothing . If not , this method throws an exception .
37716	Returns if the issuing distribution point criteria should be applied . Defaults to < code > false < /code > . < p > You may also set the issuing distribution point criteria if not a missing issuing distribution point should be assumed .
37747	Returns the record with reported alert message . The returned array of bytes is ready to be sent to another peer . Note , that this method does not automatically set the state of alert protocol in `` no alert '' state , so after wrapping the method setProcessed should be called .
37780	Returns true if the specified character is valid and permitted outside of a character reference . That is , this method will return false for the same set as isXML11Valid , except it also reports false for `` control characters '' .
37781	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
37800	Report a vetoable property update to any registered listeners . If anyone vetos the change , then fire a new event reverting everyone to the old value and then rethrow the PropertyVetoException . < P > No event is fired if old and new are equal and non-null . < P >
37801	See the general contract of the < code > reset < /code > method of < code > InputStream < /code > . < p > If < code > markpos < /code > is < code > -1 < /code > ( no mark has been set or the mark has been invalidated ) , an < code > IOException < /code > is thrown . Otherwise , < code > pos < /code > is set equal to < code > markpos < /code > .
37809	Filters the provided value to ensure that it is appropriate for use as an exit code . Exit code values are generally only allowed to be between 0 and 255 , so any value outside of this range will be converted to 255 , which is the typical exit code used to indicate an overflow value .
37811	Returns a new string that is a substring of this string . The substring begins at the specified < code > beginIndex < /code > and extends to the character at index < code > endIndex - 1 < /code > . Thus the length of the substring is < code > endIndex-beginIndex < /code > .
37817	Pushes back a portion of an array of bytes by copying it to the front of the pushback buffer . After this method returns , the next byte to be read will have the value < code > b [ off ] < /code > , the byte after that will have the value < code > b [ off+1 ] < /code > , and so forth .
37820	Add a child to the child list . NOTE : This presumes the child did not previously have a parent . Making that assumption makes this a less expensive operation -- but requires that if you *do* want to reparent a node , you use removeChild ( ) first to remove it from its previous context . Failing to do so will damage the tree .
37821	generate an X509 certificate , based on the current issuer and subject using the default provider `` BC '' , and the passed in source of randomness ( if required ) .
37823	Compares two DynAny values for equality . Two DynAny values are equal if their TypeCodes are equivalent and , recursively , all component DynAnys have equal values . The current position of the two DynAnys being compared has no effect on the result of equal .
37831	Adds this reference object to the queue with which it is registered , if any . < p > This method is invoked only by Java code ; when the garbage collector enqueues references it does so directly , without invoking this method .
37832	Looks , if the list contains a net class with trace half widths all equal to p_trace_half_width , trace clearance class equal to p_trace_clearance_class and via rule equal to p_cia_rule .
37835	Returns true if the proto file is external to the current package . Currently , it only checks the file path and thinks it is external if the file is well-known common protos .
37836	Find a map element given its name in a sorted array of map elements . This will return the index for the closest inferior or equal item in the given array .
37845	Check if this size is equal to another size . < p > Two sizes are equal if and only if both their widths and heights are equal . < /p > < p > A size object is never equal to any other type of object . < /p >
37853	< p > The variant of the UUID as per < a href= '' http : //www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt '' > RFC 4122 < /a > . < ul > < li > 0 - Reserved for NCS compatibility < /li > < li > 2 - RFC 4122/Leach-Salz < /li > < li > 6 - Reserved for Microsoft Corporation compatibility < /li > < li > 7 - Reserved for future use < /li > < /ul >
37858	Composes the name of this context with a name relative to this context . Since an initial context may never be named relative to any context other than itself , the value of the < tt > prefix < /tt > parameter must be an empty name ( < tt > '' '' < /tt > ) .
37866	Deregister a relation definition from the managed object definition . < p > This method < b > must not < /b > be called by applications and is only intended for internal testing .
37874	Transfers the currently selected range in the associated text model to the system clipboard , leaving the contents in the text model . The current selection remains intact . Does nothing for < code > null < /code > selections .
37895	Removes all components from this list and sets its size to zero . < blockquote > < b > Note : < /b > Although this method is not deprecated , the preferred method to use is < code > clear < /code > , which implements the < code > List < /code > interface defined in the 1.2 Collections framework . < /blockquote >
37901	Attempts to restart the Directory Server . This will perform an in-core restart in which the existing server instance will be shut down , a new instance will be created , and it will be reinitialized and restarted .
37905	Process a modify DN post operation using the specified map of old and new entry DNs . The boolean `` log '' is used to determine if the map is written to the log file for the background thread to pick up . If the map is to be processed in foreground , than each base DN or public naming context ( if the base DN configuration is empty ) is processed .
37909	Reads up to < code > len < /code > bytes of data from the contained input stream into an array of bytes . An attempt is made to read as many as < code > len < /code > bytes , but a smaller number may be read , possibly zero . The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer . < p > This method blocks until input data is available , end of file is detected , or an exception is thrown . < p > If < code > len < /code > is zero , then no bytes are read and < code > 0 < /code > is returned ; otherwise , there is an attempt to read at least one byte . If no byte is available because the stream is at end of file , the value < code > -1 < /code > is returned ; otherwise , at least one byte is read and stored into < code > b < /code > . < p > The first byte read is stored into element < code > b [ off ] < /code > , the next one into < code > b [ off+1 ] < /code > , and so on . The number of bytes read is , at most , equal to < code > len < /code > . Let < i > k < /i > be the number of bytes actually read ; these bytes will be stored in elements < code > b [ off ] < /code > through < code > b [ off+ < /code > < i > k < /i > < code > -1 ] < /code > , leaving elements < code > b [ off+ < /code > < i > k < /i > < code > ] < /code > through < code > b [ off+len-1 ] < /code > unaffected . < p > In every case , elements < code > b [ 0 ] < /code > through < code > b [ off ] < /code > and elements < code > b [ off+len ] < /code > through < code > b [ b.length-1 ] < /code > are unaffected .
37925	Subclasses that want to handle < code > ChangeEvents < /code > differently can override this to return a subclass of < code > ModelListener < /code > or another < code > ChangeListener < /code > implementation .
37926	Returns the round trip time for this ping in nanoseconds , or -1 if the response was canceled , or -2 if the timeout elapsed before the round trip completed .
37938	Creates the subcommand that the user must launch after doing an external initialization of the topology ( and all the specific options for the subcommand . Note : this method assumes that initializeGlobalArguments has already been called and that hostNameArg and portArg have been created .
37955	Searches for users in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of users with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
37956	Returns true if all of the fields have legal values given their names . This method always returns true , but a subclass can override it to return false when appropriate .
37965	Creates a default SIPResponse message for this request . Note You must add the necessary tags to outgoing responses if need be . For efficiency , this method does not clone the incoming request . If you want to modify the outgoing response , be sure to clone the incoming request as the headers are shared and any modification to the headers of the outgoing response will result in a modification of the incoming request . Tag fields are just copied from the incoming request . Contact headers are removed from the incoming request . Added by Jeff Keyser .
37971	Registers a component for tooltip management . < p > This will register key bindings to show and hide the tooltip text only if < code > component < /code > has focus bindings . This is done so that components that are not normally focus traversable , such as < code > JLabel < /code > , are not made focus traversable as a result of invoking this method .
37982	Adds a new policy subject . The subject is added as a normal ( non exclusive ) subject . So , policy will apply to members of the subject . The policy will apply to a user if he is a member of any normal ( non exclusive ) subject in the policy or not a member of any exclusive subject in the policy .
37996	Appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this list , in the order that they are returned by the specified collection 's iterator . The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress . ( Note that this will occur if the specified collection is this list , and it 's nonempty . )
37999	Answers a < code > boolean < /code > indicating whether or not this StringReader is ready to be read without blocking . If the result is < code > true < /code > , the next < code > read ( ) < /code > will not block . If the result is < code > false < /code > this Reader may or may not block when < code > read ( ) < /code > is sent . The implementation in StringReader always returns < code > true < /code > even when it has been closed .
38006	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue . The elements are in no particular order . < p > The returned array will be `` safe '' in that no references to it are maintained by this queue . ( In other words , this method must allocate a new array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array . < p > This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs .
38007	Invoked this to insert newChild at location index in parents children . This will then message nodesWereInserted to create the appropriate event . This is the preferred way to add children as it will create the appropriate event .
38023	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
38025	Registers the provided OID as a supported feature for the Directory Server . This will have no effect if the specified feature OID is already present in the list of supported features .

This is a hook which UI implementations may change to reflect how the UI displays bound properties of JTextComponent subclasses . This is implemented to rebuild the ActionMap based upon an EditorKit change .
38032	Sets item to self and waiter to null , to avoid garbage retention after matching or cancelling . Uses relaxed writes because order is already constrained in the only calling contexts : item is forgotten only after volatile/atomic mechanics that extract items . Similarly , clearing waiter follows either CAS or return from park ( if ever parked ; else we do n't care ) .
38040	Wrapper for session manager execute async method . This method wraps the original method and , in addition , measures the statement execution time and reports the query towards the diagnostics core .
38048	Determines the revision value to use for the eTag attribute in the result . Currently just uses the last modified timestamp . Currently etag values are not validated for requests .
38051	Calls < code > dragDropEnd < /code > on the < code > DragSourceListener < /code > s registered with this < code > DragSourceContext < /code > and with the associated < code > DragSource < /code > , and passes them the specified < code > DragSourceDropEvent < /code > .
38062	This function is called after everything else has been recomposed , and allows the template to set remaining values that may be based on some other property that depends on recomposition .
38068	When the request has been completed , the replication valve will notify the manager , and the manager will decide whether any replication is needed or not . If there is a need for replication , the manager will create a session message and that will be replicated . The cluster determines where it gets sent .
38069	Flush the servletOutputStream or printWriter ( only one will be non-null ) This must be called after a requestDispatcher.include , since we ca n't assume that the included servlet flushed its stream .
38070	Initializes the cause of this exception to the specified value . The cause is the throwable that caused this naming exception to be thrown . < p > This method may be called at most once .
38076	Creates an any value from a DynAny object . A copy of the TypeCode associated with the DynAny object is assigned to the resulting any . The value associated with the DynAny object is copied into the any .
38079	< p > Generates a variant 2 , version 3 ( name-based , MD5-hashed ) UUID as per < a href= '' http : //www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt '' > RFC 4122 < /a > .
38083	Lays out this < code > Container < /code > . If editing , the editor will be placed at < code > offset < /code > in the x direction and 0 for y .
38086	See < code > readObject < /code > and < code > writeObject < /code > in < code > JComponent < /code > for more information about serialization in Swing .
38090	Determine whether this resolution attribute 's value is less than or equal to the given resolution attribute 's value . This is true if all of the following conditions are true : < UL > < LI > This attribute 's cross feed direction resolution is less than or equal to the < CODE > other < /CODE > attribute 's cross feed direction resolution . < LI > This attribute 's feed direction resolution is less than or equal to the < CODE > other < /CODE > attribute 's feed direction resolution . < /UL >
38110	Will terminate the application . Call this on every exit of the app to ensure proper termination . Failure to do so may result in unpredictable behavior of this instance of RoboZonky or future ones .
38113	Notifies all of the listeners registered with this < code > RowSet < /code > object that its cursor has moved . < P > When an application calls a method to move the cursor , that method moves the cursor and then calls this method internally . An application < b > should < /b > never invoke this method directly .
38114	Compares this Session ID to the specified object . The result is true if and only if the argument is not null and the random string and server name are the same in both objects .
38139	Adds the specified item listener to receive item events from this list . Item events are sent in response to user input , but not in response to calls to < code > select < /code > or < code > deselect < /code > . If listener < code > l < /code > is < code > null < /code > , no exception is thrown and no action is performed . < p > Refer to < a href= '' doc-files/AWTThreadIssues.html # ListenersThreads '' > AWT Threading Issues < /a > for details on AWT 's threading model .
38144	Returns a new < code > JViewport < /code > by default . Used to create the viewport ( as needed ) in < code > setViewportView < /code > , < code > setRowHeaderView < /code > , and < code > setColumnHeaderView < /code > . Subclasses may override this method to return a subclass of < code > JViewport < /code > .
38146	Creates a list data listener which will be added to the < code > ComboBoxModel < /code > . If this method returns null then it will not be added to the combo box model .
38176	Defines a new character reference . The reference 's name and value are supplied . Nothing happens if the character reference is already defined . < p > Unlike internal entities , character references are a string to single character mapping . They are used to map non-ASCII characters both on parsing and printing , primarily for HTML documents . ' & amp ; lt ; ' is an example of a character reference. < /p >
38183	Assign current thread to the subscriber object . To make it work , the thread have to have a Looper ( Looper.myLooper ( ) ! = null ) . If current thread have no Looper , all event handlers marked with DELIVER_IN_DEFAULT_THREAD , it will be executed as DELIVER_IN_BACKGROUND_THREAD . < p/ > This method can be used to re-assign the default thread for already registered object .
38185	Applies the provided modifications to an entry using `` strict '' modify semantics . Attempts to add duplicate values or attempts to remove values which do not exist will cause the update to fail .
38212	< p > Are trace messages currently enabled ? < /p > < p > This allows expensive operations such as < code > String < /code > concatenation to be avoided when the message will be ignored by the logger . < /p >
38223	Returns < code > true < /code > if rhs is a < code > TransformAttribute < /code > whose transform is equal to this < code > TransformAttribute < /code > 's transform .
38229	Returns < code > true < /code > if this reader allows the source image to be rendered at an arbitrary size as part of the decoding process , by means of the < code > setSourceRenderSize < /code > method . If this method returns < code > false < /code > , calls to < code > setSourceRenderSize < /code > will throw an < code > UnsupportedOperationException < /code > .
38238	Starts the login process for the given < code > AuthContext < /code > object identified by the index type and index name . The < code > IndexType < /code > defines the possible kinds of `` objects '' or `` resources '' for which an authentication can be performed . Currently supported index types are users , roles , services ( or application ) , levels , resources and mechanism . It allows the caller to pass in the desired locale for this request .
38240	Reads up to len bytes of data from the save buffer or channel buffer into an array of bytes . An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes , but a smaller number may be read . The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer . If b is null , a NullPointerException is thrown . If the length of b is zero , then no bytes are read and 0 is returned ; otherwise , there is an attempt to read at least one byte . If no byte is available in the save buffer or channel buffer , IllegalBlockingModeException will be thrown ; otherwise , at least one byte is read and stored into b . The first byte read is stored into element b [ 0 ] , the next one into b [ o1 ] , and so on . The number of bytes read is , at most , equal to the length of b . Let k be the number of bytes actually read ; these bytes will be stored in elements b [ 0 ] through b [ k-1 ] , leaving elements b [ k ] through b [ b.length-1 ] unaffected .
38244	Notify all event listeners that this data provider has changed state due to an operational error , configuration change , or an administrative action . < p > This method can be used to forward events to parent data providers .
38268	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a character array using the specified character encoding . < p > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
38275	Deletes the component at the specified index . Each component in this vector with an index greater or equal to the specified index is shifted downward to have an index one smaller than the value it had previously .
38292	Returns true if the current ( now ) timestamp is within the specified time interval . The supplied interval string should contain an ISO 8601 formatted interval string and may be of the formats 'datetime/datetime ' , 'datetime/period ' or 'period/datetime '
38294	Creates a new connection factory using the named configuration in the provided JSON list of factory configurations . See the sample configuration file for a detailed description of its content .
38297	Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it has been loaded into the system . It is always called before the first time that the < code > start < /code > method is called . < p > A subclass of < code > Applet < /code > should override this method if it has initialization to perform . For example , an applet with threads would use the < code > init < /code > method to create the threads and the < code > destroy < /code > method to kill them . < p > The implementation of this method provided by the < code > Applet < /code > class does nothing .
38302	Obtains the length of the track , expressed in MIDI ticks . ( The duration of a tick in seconds is determined by the timing resolution of the < code > Sequence < /code > containing this track , and also by the tempo of the music as set by the sequencer . )
38311	Returns the result code having the specified integer value as defined in RFC 4511 section 4.1.9 . If there is no result code associated with the specified integer value then a temporary result code is automatically created in order to handle cases where unexpected result codes are returned from the server .
38319	Creates and returns an instance of < code > TreeModelHandler < /code > . The returned object is responsible for updating the expanded state when the < code > TreeModel < /code > changes . < p > For more information on what expanded state means , see the < a href= # jtree_description > JTree description < /a > above .
38332	Line wrap ` str ` , returning a list of lines . Each line in the returned list is guaranteed to not have new line characters . The first line begins with ` firstLinePrefix ` ( defaults to empty ) , while subsequent lines begin with a hanging indent of equal width .
38349	Generates a valid ASCII property list which has this NSDictionary as its root object . The generated property list complies with the format as described in < a href= '' https : //developer.apple.com/library/mac/ # documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PropertyLists/OldStylePlists/OldStylePLists.html '' > Property List Programming Guide - Old-Style ASCII Property Lists < /a > .
38358	Acquires the read lock for the specified entry . This method will block if the entry is already write locked or if the entry , or any of its parents , have the subtree write lock taken .
38367	Provides a mapping from the view coordinate space to the logical coordinate space of the model . This is implemented to first make sure the zone is loaded before providing the superclass behavior .
38368	Sends the entry if it matches the base , scope and filter of the current search operation . It will also send the base changelog entry if it needs to be sent and was not sent before .
38369	Adds a column to the model . The new column will have the identifier < code > columnName < /code > , which may be null . This method will send a < code > tableChanged < /code > notification message to all the listeners . This method is a cover for < code > addColumn ( Object , Vector ) < /code > which uses < code > null < /code > as the data vector .
38374	Implements the same behaviour as the `` touch '' utility on Unix . It creates a new file with size 0 or , if the file exists already , it is opened and closed without modifying it , but updating the file date and time . < p > NOTE : As from v1.3 , this method throws an IOException if the last modified date of the file can not be set . Also , as from v1.3 this method creates parent directories if they do not exist .
38378	Return a < code > swing.properties < /code > file key for the attribute of specified look and feel . The attr is either `` name '' or `` class '' , a typical key would be : `` swing.installedlaf.windows.name ''
38384	Throws an < code > org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT < /code > exception with the message `` This is a locally constrained object . '' This method is the default implementation of the < code > org.omg.CORBA.Object < /code > method. < P >
38385	Determine if the object is showing . This is determined by checking the visibility of the object and visibility of the object ancestors . Note : this will return true even if the object is obscured by another ( for example , it to object is underneath a menu that was pulled down ) .
38388	For performance reasons , we would like not to acquire a lock in hasNext in the common case . To allow for this , we only access fields ( i.e . nextItem ) that are not modified by update operations triggered by queue modifications .
38394	returns the last corner of this trace , which is the intersection of the last two lines of its polyline It MUST return an int point otherwise I will notbe able to connect to a pin ! ! ! Well , it would be nice if it was that easy . not , unfortunately .
38418	Compares this string to the specified object . The result is < code > true < /code > if and only if the argument is not < code > null < /code > and is a < code > String < /code > object that represents the same sequence of characters as this object .
38426	Removes the < code > ResponseProvider < /code > object identified by object 's < code > equals < /code > method . If a responseProvider instance does not exist , the method will return silently .
38427	Replaces an existing subject with the same name by the current one . If a subject with the same name does not exist , it will be added . The policy will apply to a user if he is a member of any normal ( non exclusive ) subject in the policy or not a member of any exclusive subject in the policy .
38432	Gets a RenderedImage instance of this image with a default width and height in pixels . The RenderContext is built automatically with an appropriate usr2dev transform and an area of interest of the full image . All the rendering hints come from hints passed in . Implementors of this interface must be sure that there is a defined default width and height .
38452	Returns an enumeration of strings representing the header field names . Field names may appear multiple times in this enumeration , indicating that multiple fields with that name exist in this header .
38456	Adds the specified component to the layout , using the specified < code > constraints < /code > object . Note that constraints are mutable and are , therefore , cloned when cached .
38461	Searches for roles in this organizational unit using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of roles with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
38475	Notification from the < code > UIFactory < /code > that the L & amp ; F has changed . Called to replace the UI with the latest version from the < code > UIFactory < /code > .
38477	Determines that with the given organization ( or , sub-organization , or container ) name , if a new resource can be created or not . Only root level organization/realm has the privilege to create any resource .
38497	Returns the arc sine of a value ; the returned angle is in the range - < i > pi < /i > /2 through < i > pi < /i > /2 . Special cases : < ul > < li > If the argument is NaN or its absolute value is greater than 1 , then the result is NaN . < li > If the argument is zero , then the result is a zero with the same sign as the argument. < /ul > < p > The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result . Results must be semi-monotonic .
38512	Does < i > not < /i > remove a parameter . Parameter stacks are read-only . It is possible , though discouraged , to access and modify specific stack entries . Derived classes may change this behavior .
38520	Tests if this input stream supports the < code > mark < /code > and < code > reset < /code > methods . The < code > markSupported < /code > method of < code > InflaterInputStream < /code > returns < code > false < /code > .
38522	Returns a String that contains the html passed as parameter with a span applied . The span style corresponds to the Font specified as parameter . The goal of this method is to be able to specify a font for an HTML string .
38530	Searches for roles in this organizational unit using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of roles with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
38533	Compares two DynAny values for equality . Two DynAny values are equal if their TypeCodes are equivalent and , recursively , all component DynAnys have equal values . The current position of the two DynAnys being compared has no effect on the result of equal .
38535	Whether the directory is traversable or not . This might be useful , for example , if you want a directory to represent a compound document and do n't want the user to descend into it .
38536	< strong > ANDROID INTERPOLATOR < /strong > < br/ > < br/ > Interpolator corresponding to fast_out_linear_in . Uses a lookup table for the Bezier curve from ( 0,0 ) to ( 1,1 ) with control points : P0 ( 0 , 0 ) P1 ( 0.4 , 0 ) P2 ( 1.0 , 1.0 ) P3 ( 1.0 , 1.0 )
38538	Removes the < code > ResponseProvider < /code > object identified by responseProvider 's name . If a responseProvider instance with the given name does not exist , the method will return silently .
38539	This method is a hack to get around the fact that we can not directly override setUIProperty because part of the inheritance hierarchy goes outside of the javax.swing package , and therefore calling a package private method is n't allowed . This method should return true if the property was handled , and false otherwise .
38541	Removes the < code > TextComponent < /code > 's peer . The peer allows us to modify the appearance of the < code > TextComponent < /code > without changing its functionality .
38546	Adds a < code > component < /code > and < code > tip < /code > represented by a < code > title < /code > and/or < code > icon < /code > , either of which can be < code > null < /code > . Cover method for < code > insertTab < /code > .
38547	Returns a method handle which always delegates either to the target or the fallback . The method handle will delegate to the target exactly as long as the switch point is valid . After that , it will permanently delegate to the fallback . < p > The target and fallback must be of exactly the same method type , and the resulting combined method handle will also be of this type .
38549	Compares the specified Object with this < code > ADPrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns true if the given object is also a < code > ADPrincipal < /code > and the two < code > ADPrincipal < /code > s have the same username .
38561	Returns the current value of the counter < code > written < /code > , the number of bytes written to this data output stream so far . If the counter overflows , it will be wrapped to Integer.MAX_VALUE .
38576	Checks whether the specified point is within this object 's bounds , where the point 's x and y coordinates are defined to be relative to the coordinate system of the object .
38583	Throws an < code > org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT < /code > exception with the message `` This is a locally constrained object . '' This method is the default implementation of the < code > org.omg.CORBA.Object < /code > method. < P >
38590	Create a large set of attributes that should trade off space for time . This set will not be shared . This is a hook for subclasses that want to alter the behavior of the larger attribute storage format ( which is SimpleAttributeSet by default ) . This can be reimplemented to return a MutableAttributeSet that provides some sort of attribute conversion .
38593	Compare this field with another < code > ObjectStreamField < /code > . Return -1 if this is smaller , 0 if equal , 1 if greater . Types that are primitives are `` smaller '' than object types . If equal , the field names are compared .
38603	Obtains and ignores the next task that the executor would otherwise execute , if one is immediately available , and then retries execution of task r , unless the executor is shut down , in which case task r is instead discarded .
38615	Encodes the Strings and returns the number of characters in the two encoded Strings that are the same . This return value ranges from 0 through 4 : 0 indicates little or no similarity , and 4 indicates strong similarity or identical values .
38627	This method is called by Session.getLocalServerSessionServiceURL , when routing a request to an individual session host . In this case , the SessionID.PRIMARY_ID extension is obtained from the SessionID instance ( which corresponds to the AM-instance host of the session ) . WebtopNaming will then be called to turn this serverId ( 01,02 , etc ) into a URL which will point a PLL client GetSession request . Calling this method is part of insuring that the PLL GetSession request does not get routed to a site ( load-balancer ) . This method checks whether the provided ID ( let it be server or site ID ) belongs to a local site . If the current server is not member of a site , then the ID will be compared to the current server 's ID .
38628	Turn an object into an < code > ObjectId < /code > , if possible . Strings will be converted into < code > ObjectId < /code > s , if possible , and < code > ObjectId < /code > s will be cast and returned . Passing in < code > null < /code > returns < code > null < /code > .
38633	generate a signed object that for a CMS Signed Data object using the given provider - if encapsulate is true a copy of the message will be included in the signature . The content type is set according to the OID represented by the string signedContentType .
38639	Returns a Set view of the keys contained in this Cache . The Set is backed by the Cache , so changes to the Cache are reflected in the Set , and vice-versa . The Set supports element removal ( which removes the corresponding entry from the Cache ) , but not element addition .
38641	Removes the provided operation from the set of operations in progress for this client connection . Note that this does not make any attempt to cancel any processing that may already be in progress for the operation .
38642	Set the byte count back to 0 . < p > NOTE : This method is an alternative for < code > resetCount ( ) < /code > and was added because that method returns an integer which will result in incorrect count for files over 2GB .
38645	Writes a < code > java.sql.Timestamp < /code > object in the Java programming language to this < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > object . The driver converts it to an SQL < code > TIMESTAMP < /code > before returning it to the database .
38671	Log a method return . < p > This is a convenience method that can be used to log returning from a method . A LogRecord with message `` RETURN '' , log level FINER , and the given sourceMethod and sourceClass is logged . < p >
38678	Save an online store to the persistence layer . This is a so called ` upsert ` operation . This is used to update store info , or just apply for a new store .
38681	For events that mark/span the beginning and end of something , call this method to mark the beginning of the event window . Upon reaching the end of the event window , end ( ) SHOULD be called on the returned EventEntry , even in failure condiitons . For example call end ( ) in a try/finally ; or at the very least the EventEntry should be unreferenced so it gets garbage collected . Event entries where end ( ) was not called do not qualify for inclusion in statistics and may not be in the event history .
38682	Called as the cursor 's hotspot enters a platform-dependent drop site . This method is invoked when all the following conditions are true : < UL > < LI > The cursor 's hotspot enters the operable part of a platform-dependent drop site . < LI > The drop site is active . < LI > The drop site accepts the drag . < /UL >
38688	Searches for static groups in this organizational unit using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of static groups with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
38702	Attempts to do an in-place rewrite of the exif metadata using the tags in this ExifInterface object . If this fails , fall back to overwriting file . This preserves tags that are not being rewritten .
38712	Build authentication mechanism that will keep the session alive via the use of session token . The mechanism will never log out , but the session may expire if not refresh regularly . This is potentially unsafe , as it will eventually store a plain-text access token on the hard drive , for everyone to see . The token will only be refreshed if RoboZonky is launched some time between the token expiration and 60 seconds before then .
38719	Report an element type declaration . < p > The content model will consist of the string `` EMPTY '' , the string `` ANY '' , or a parenthesised group , optionally followed by an occurrence indicator . The model will be normalized so that all whitespace is removed , and will include the enclosing parentheses. < /p >
38731	Calls < code > drop < /code > on the registered < code > DropTargetListener < /code > and passes it the specified < code > DropTargetDropEvent < /code > if this < code > DropTarget < /code > is active .
38742	Returns the foo where uuid = & # 63 ; and groupId = & # 63 ; or returns < code > null < /code > if it could not be found , optionally using the finder cache .
38750	Sets item to self and waiter to null , to avoid garbage retention after matching or cancelling . Uses relaxed writes because order is already constrained in the only calling contexts : item is forgotten only after volatile/atomic mechanics that extract items . Similarly , clearing waiter follows either CAS or return from park ( if ever parked ; else we do n't care ) .
38763	This hook is called whenever an item in your options menu is selected . The default implementation simply returns false to have the normal processing happen ( calling the item 's Runnable or sending a message to its Handler as appropriate ) . You can use this method for any items for which you would like to do processing without those other facilities . < p > Derived classes should call through to the base class for it to perform the default menu handling .
38776	Update the layout in response to receiving notification of change from the model . This is implemented to note the change on the ChildLocator so that offsets of the children will be correctly computed .
38782	Checks two BasicPermission objects for equality . Checks that < i > obj < /i > 's class is the same as this object 's class and has the same name as this object . < P >
38787	Returns a deep copy of this iterator . Cloned iterators may not be restartable . The iterator being cloned may or may not become non-restartable as a side effect of this operation .
38788	Advances the current position to the next component . The operation returns true while the resulting current position indicates a component , false otherwise . A false return value leaves the current position at -1 . Invoking next on a DynAny without components leaves the current position at -1 and returns false .
38799	Skips < code > n < /code > bytes of input from this input stream . Fewer bytes might be skipped if the end of the input stream is reached .
38813	Installs non-rollover borders on all the child components of the JComponent . A non-rollover border is the border that is installed on the child component while it is in the toolbar . < p > This is a convenience method to call < code > setBorderToNonRollover < /code > for each child component .
38824	Called on < code > DataFlavor < /code > for every MIME Type parameter to allow < code > DataFlavor < /code > subclasses to handle special parameters like the text/plain < code > charset < /code > parameters , whose values are case insensitive . ( MIME type parameter values are supposed to be case sensitive . < p > This method is called for each parameter name/value pair and should return the normalized representation of the < code > parameterValue < /code > . This method is never invoked by this implementation from 1.1 onwards .
38826	Checks if the year is a leap year , according to the ISO proleptic calendar system rules . < p > This method applies the current rules for leap years across the whole time-line . In general , a year is a leap year if it is divisible by four without remainder . However , years divisible by 100 , are not leap years , with the exception of years divisible by 400 which are . < p > For example , 1904 is a leap year it is divisible by 4 . 1900 was not a leap year as it is divisible by 100 , however 2000 was a leap year as it is divisible by 400 . < p > The calculation is proleptic - applying the same rules into the far future and far past . This is historically inaccurate , but is correct for the ISO-8601 standard .
38834	Returns true if edits may be redone . If < code > end < /code > has been invoked , this returns the value from super . Otherwise , this returns true if there are any edits to be redone ( < code > editToBeRedone < /code > returns non- < code > null < /code > ) .
38837	Add a named logger . This does nothing and returns false if a logger with the same name is already registered . < p > The Logger factory methods call this method to register each newly created Logger . < p > The application should retain its own reference to the Logger object to avoid it being garbage collected . The LogManager may only retain a weak reference .
38840	This method may be overridden by subclasses to provide their own release behaviors . When invoked any resources held by this instance obtained from its current BeanContext property should be released since the object is no longer nested within that BeanContext .
38844	< strong > ANDROID INTERPOLATOR < /strong > < br/ > < br/ > Create an Interpolator for an arbitrary Path . The Path must begin at ( 0 , 0 ) and end at ( 1 , 1 ) . The x-coordinate along the Path is the input value and the output is the y coordinate of the line at that point . This means that the Path must conform to a function y = f ( x ) .
38845	Unsuppresses the standard output streams . Following a call to this method System.out and System.err will point to the descriptor prior to calling < code > suppress ( ) < /code > .
38846	Closes this input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream . A closed < code > SequenceInputStream < /code > can not perform input operations and can not be reopened . < p > If this stream was created from an enumeration , all remaining elements are requested from the enumeration and closed before the < code > close < /code > method returns .
38855	Returns a boolean indicating whether the byte order used in the the TIFF file is big-endian ( i.e . whether the byte order is from the most significant to the least significant )
38856	Ask whether we support a given DOM feature . In fact , we do not _fully_ support any DOM feature -- we 're a read-only subset -- so arguably we should always return false . On the other hand , it may be more practically useful to return true and simply treat the whole DOM as read-only , failing on the methods we ca n't support . I 'm not sure which would be more useful to the caller .
38861	Checks whether the specified point is within this object 's bounds , where the point 's x and y coordinates are defined to be relative to the coordinate system of the object .
38870	Searches for users in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of users with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .

38895	Terminate the current line by writing the line separator string . The line separator string is defined by the system property < code > line.separator < /code > , and is not necessarily a single newline character ( < code > '\n ' < /code > ) .
38897	Writes out the & lt ; head & gt ; and & lt ; style & gt ; tags , and then invokes writeStyles ( ) to write out all the named styles as the content of the & lt ; style & gt ; tag . The content is surrounded by valid HTML comment markers to ensure that the document is viewable in applications/browsers that do not support the tag .
38900	Returns whether this printer info attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class PrinterInfo . < LI > This printer info attribute 's underlying string and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's underlying string are equal . < LI > This printer info attribute 's locale and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's locale are equal . < /OL >
38905	Creates a writer for the provided log writer , parser and size for blocks . < p > This method is intended for tests only , to allow tuning of the block size .
38909	Redefine this ExtendedType object to represent a different extended type . This is intended to be used ONLY on the hashET object . Using it elsewhere will mess up existing hashtable entries !
38919	Adds the client to its appropriate baseProfileMap & styleMap . Ex : Nokia7110 , with Nokia style & WML for its baseProfile , will go into wmlProfilesMap under Nokia styles . ( Used only for displaying Styles & Clients under Base in the console plug-in ) . Currently Aligo only supports 1 level of Style . Only the baseProfiles immediate children are eligible to be Styles .
38927	Tells whether this stream is ready to be read . An InputStreamReader is ready if its input buffer is not empty , or if bytes are available to be read from the underlying byte stream .
38944	Writes a String to a file creating the file if it does not exist . NOTE : As from v1.3 , the parent directories of the file will be created if they do not exist .
38950	Moves the focus down one focus traversal cycle . If aContainer is a focus cycle root , then the focus owner is set to aContainer 's default Component to focus , and the current focus cycle root is set to aContainer . If aContainer is not a focus cycle root , then no focus traversal operation occurs .
38984	Removes a < code > VetoableChangeListener < /code > . If < code > pcl < /code > was added more than once to the same event source for the specified property , it will be notified one less time after being removed . If < code > name < /code > is null , no exception is thrown and no action is taken . If < code > vcl < /code > is null , or was never added for the specified property , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .
38991	Indicates whether this client connection is currently using a secure mechanism to communicate with the server . Note that this may change over time based on operations performed by the client or server ( e.g. , it may go from < CODE > false < /CODE > to < CODE > true < /CODE > if the client uses the StartTLS extended operation ) .
39022	Writes the specified byte ( the low eight bits of the argument < code > b < /code > ) to the underlying output stream .

39028	Removes a state from the current state set . If the state is not in the set , the state set will be unchanged and the return value will be false . If the state is in the state set , it will be removed from the set and the return value will be true .
39031	Does < i > not < /i > copy parameters . Parameter stacks are lightweight objects , expected to be instantiated as needed and to be used only in a very specific context . On top of that , they are read-only . The typical copy operation to prevent accidental modification of parameters passed by the application to a framework object is therefore pointless and disabled . Create a new stack if you really need a copy . < br/ > Derived classes may change this behavior .
39042	Normally causes every selected item in the object to be selected if the object supports multiple selections . This method makes no sense in a menu bar , and so does nothing .
39043	Removes the organization names from the list of organization names that can import the service configuration . If the organization has already imported the service configutation , it would have to be undone before the organization name can be removed from the list . The organization names must be fully qualified , starting with a forward slash `` / '' . To specify an entire sub-tree that can use the service configuration , a `` * '' would have to be appended after the final forward slash . For example `` /a/b/c/* '' would imply all sub-organization under `` /a/b/c '' can use this service configuration .
39048	Obtains the key as a localized string . If a localized string can not be found for the key , the locale independent key stored in the role will be returned .
39050	Returns the character at the specified index . An index ranges from < code > 0 < /code > to < code > length ( ) - 1 < /code > . The first character of the sequence is at index < code > 0 < /code > , the next at index < code > 1 < /code > , and so on , as for array indexing .

39093	Appends an LDIF separator and properly-encoded form of the given value to the provided buffer . If the value is safe to include as-is , then a single colon , a single space , space , and the provided value will be appended . Otherwise , two colons , a single space , and a base64-encoded form of the value will be appended .
39096	Inserts the specified node in this vector at the specified index . Each component in this vector with an index greater or equal to the specified index is shifted upward to have an index one greater than the value it had previously .
39100	Compares the specified object with this < code > ObjID < /code > for equality . This method returns < code > true < /code > if and only if the specified object is an < code > ObjID < /code > instance with the same object number and address space identifier as this one .

39105	Adds each path in the array of paths to the current selection . If any component of any of the paths is n't viewable and < code > getExpandsSelectedPaths < /code > is true , it is made viewable . < p > Note that < code > JTree < /code > does not allow duplicate nodes to exist as children under the same parent -- each sibling must be a unique object .
39135	Advances the current position to the next component . The operation returns true while the resulting current position indicates a component , false otherwise . A false return value leaves the current position at -1 . Invoking next on a DynAny without components leaves the current position at -1 and returns false .
39136	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a character array using the default character encoding of the platform . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
39145	Assigns the specified Object reference to each element of the specified range of the specified array of Objects . The range to be filled extends from index < tt > fromIndex < /tt > , inclusive , to index < tt > toIndex < /tt > , exclusive . ( If < tt > fromIndex==toIndex < /tt > , the range to be filled is empty . )
39156	Returns a ( possibly empty ) collection view of the CRLs read from the given input stream inStream . The inStream may contain a sequence of DER-encoded CRLs , or a PKCS # 7 CRL set . This is a PKCS # 7 SignedData object , with the only signficant field being crls . In particular the signature and the contents are ignored .
39157	Generates an asymmetric key pair in the Android Keystore . Every use of the private key must be authorized by the user authenticating with fingerprint . Public key use is unrestricted .
39161	Deletes the underlying storage for a file item , including deleting any associated temporary disk file . Although this storage will be deleted automatically when the < code > FileItem < /code > instance is garbage collected , this method can be used to ensure that this is done at an earlier time , thus preserving system resources .
39169	Destroys the debug object , closes the debug file and releases any system resources . Note that the debug file will remain open until < code > destroy ( ) < /code > is invoked . To conserve file resources , you should invoke < code > destroy ( ) < /code > explicitly rather than wait for the garbage collector to clean up . < p/ > < p > If this object is accessed after < code > destroy ( ) < /code > has been invoked , the results are undefined . < /p >
39171	Returns a field to access the day of week , computed based on a WeekFields . < p > The WeekDefintion of the first day of the week is used with the ISO DAY_OF_WEEK field to compute week boundaries .

39178	Check if this < tt > Handler < /tt > would actually log a given < tt > LogRecord < /tt > into its internal buffer . < p > This method checks if the < tt > LogRecord < /tt > has an appropriate level and whether it satisfies any < tt > Filter < /tt > . However it does < b > not < /b > check whether the < tt > LogRecord < /tt > would result in a `` push '' of the buffer contents . It will return false if the < tt > LogRecord < /tt > is null . < p >
39179	Compares two DynAny values for equality . Two DynAny values are equal if their TypeCodes are equivalent and , recursively , all component DynAnys have equal values . The current position of the two DynAnys being compared has no effect on the result of equal .

The string representation consists of the string representation of the binding and the string representation of this search result 's attributes , separated by ' : ' . The contents of this string is useful for debugging and is not meant to be interpreted programmatically .
39198	Receive notification of the end of a Namespace mapping . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the start of each element ( such as allocating a new tree node or writing output to a file ) . < /p >
39200	Return true if the specified text requires bidi analysis . If this returns false , the text will display left-to-right . Clients can then avoid constructing a Bidi object . Text in the Arabic Presentation Forms area of Unicode is presumed to already be shaped and ordered for display , and so will not cause this function to return true .
39205	Returns the designated type as an alternative object to be used when writing an object to a stream . This method would be used when for example serializing TransactionState.EARLY and deserializing it afterwards results again in TransactionState.EARLY . If you do not implement readResolve ( ) , you would not get TransactionState.EARLY but an instance with similar content .
39208	Ensures that the Directory Server is running . Also , create a very small test dictionary file to use for the test cases so we do n't suffer from loading the real word list every time .
39211	Returns true if this pool allows core threads to time out and terminate if no tasks arrive within the keepAlive time , being replaced if needed when new tasks arrive . When true , the same keep-alive policy applying to non-core threads applies also to core threads . When false ( the default ) , core threads are never terminated due to lack of incoming tasks .
39223	Called if InstanceID token is updated . This may occur if the security of the previous token had been compromised . Note that this is called when the InstanceID token is initially generated so this is where you would retrieve the token .
39228	Tells if this NodeSetDTM is `` fresh '' , in other words , if the first nextNode ( ) that is called will return the first node in the set .
39230	Creates an independent view of this object ( with it 's own file pointer and push back queue ) . Closing the new object will not close this object . Closing this object will have adverse effect on the view .
39232	The < code > doFilter < /code > method of the Filter is called by the container each time a request/response pair is passed through the chain due to a client request for a resource at the end of the chain . The FilterChain passed in to this method allows the Filter to pass on the request and response to the next entity in the chain . < p > A typical implementation of this method would follow the following pattern : - < br > 1 . Examine the request < br > 2 . Optionally wrap the request object with a custom implementation to filter content or headers for input filtering < br > 3 . Optionally wrap the response object with a custom implementation to filter content or headers for output filtering < br > 4. a ) < strong > Either < /strong > invoke the next entity in the chain using the FilterChain object ( < code > chain.doFilter ( ) < /code > ) , < br > 4. b ) < strong > or < /strong > not pass on the request/response pair to the next entity in the filter chain to block the request processing < br > 5 . Directly set headers on the response after invocation of the next entity in the filter chain . This default implementation simply calls the next filter in the filter chain .
39234	Checks whether the supplied Throwable is an instance of < code > InvocationTargetException < /code > and returns the throwable that is wrapped by it , if there is any .
39242	Adds a single component at a specified position within this LDAP name . Components of this LDAP name at or after the index ( if any ) of the new component are shifted up by one ( away from index 0 ) to accommodate the new component .
39256	Throws < code > CannotUndoException < /code > if < code > canUndo < /code > returns < code > false < /code > . Sets < code > hasBeenDone < /code > to < code > false < /code > . Subclasses should override to undo the operation represented by this edit . Override should begin with a call to super .
39260	Scans the next token of the input as a < tt > byte < /tt > . < p > An invocation of this method of the form < tt > nextByte ( ) < /tt > behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation < tt > nextByte ( radix ) < /tt > , where < code > radix < /code > is the default radix of this scanner .
39266	Copies the specified range of the specified array into a new array . The initial index of the range ( < tt > from < /tt > ) must lie between zero and < tt > original.length < /tt > , inclusive . The value at < tt > original [ from ] < /tt > is placed into the initial element of the copy ( unless < tt > from == original.length < /tt > or < tt > from == to < /tt > ) . Values from subsequent elements in the original array are placed into subsequent elements in the copy . The final index of the range ( < tt > to < /tt > ) , which must be greater than or equal to < tt > from < /tt > , may be greater than < tt > original.length < /tt > , in which case < tt > null < /tt > is placed in all elements of the copy whose index is greater than or equal to < tt > original.length - from < /tt > . The length of the returned array will be < tt > to - from < /tt > . < p > The resulting array is of exactly the same class as the original array .
39276	Register instance key-pair public-key certificate provided in serverProperties : generate a key-id attribute if one is not provided ( as expected ) ; add an instance key public-key certificate entry for the key certificate ; and associate the certificate entry with the server entry via the key ID attribute .

Else if listener-l is an instance of AWTEventMulticaster , then it removes the old listener from it . Else , returns listener l .
39289	Adds a < code > Subject < /code > object to the this instance of user collection . Since the name is not provided it will be dynamically assigned such that it is unique within this instance of the user collection . However if a subject entry with the same name already exists in the user collection < code > NameAlreadyExistsException < /code > will be thrown . The subject is added as a normal ( non exclusive ) subject . So , policy will apply to members of the subject .
39302	Finds the implementation Class object in the specified order . The specified order is the following : < ol > < li > query the system property using < code > System.getProperty < /code > < li > read < code > $ java.home/lib/ < i > propertiesFilename < /i > < /code > file < li > read < code > META-INF/services/ < i > factoryId < /i > < /code > file < li > use fallback classname < /ol >

39385	Calculates the index that would be used in this < tt > TabularData < /tt > instance to refer to the specified composite data < var > value < /var > parameter if it were added to this instance . This method checks for the type validity of the specified < var > value < /var > , but does not check if the calculated index is already used to refer to a value in this < tt > TabularData < /tt > instance .
39386	Adds the specified item to the the scrolling list at the position indicated by the index . The index is zero-based . If the value of the index is less than zero , or if the value of the index is greater than or equal to the number of items in the list , then the item is added to the end of the list .
39387	Indicates that rejected entries should be written to the provided output stream . Note that this applies only to entries that are rejected because they are invalid ( e.g. , are malformed or do n't conform to schema requirements ) , and not to entries that are rejected because they matched exclude criteria .
39395	Starts the login process for the given < code > AuthContext < /code > object identified by the index type and index name with certain parameters and environment map . The < code > IndexType < /code > defines the possible kinds of `` objects '' or `` resources '' for which an authentication can be performed . Currently supported index types are users , roles , services ( or application ) , levels , modules and resources .
39399	Whether or not the contents of the buffer strategy is in sync with the window . This is set to true when the root pane paints all , and false when contents are lost/restored .
39406	Returns the designated type as an alternative object to be used when writing an object to a stream . This method would be used when for example serializing Timeout.RETRANSMIT and deserializing it afterwards results again in Timeout.RETRANSMIT . If you do not implement readResolve ( ) , you would not get Timeout.RETRANSMIT but an instance with similar content .
39416	Returns a copy of this period with the specified days subtracted . < p > This subtracts the amount from the days unit in a copy of this period . The years and months units are unaffected . For example , `` 1 year , 6 months and 3 days '' minus 2 days returns `` 1 year , 6 months and 1 day '' . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .
39436	Determines whether the newly created managed object which is about to be added to the server configuration satisfies this constraint . < p > If the constraint is not satisfied , the implementation must return < code > false < /code > and add a message describing why the constraint was not satisfied . < p > The default implementation is to return < code > true < /code > .

39451	Converts a String or an array of character bytes representing hexidecimal values into an array of bytes of those same values . The returned array will be half the length of the passed String or array , as it takes two characters to represent any given byte . An exception is thrown if the passed char array has an odd number of elements .
39452	Returns a specifier for an interleaved image format that will use a < code > ComponentColorModel < /code > and a < code > PixelInterleavedSampleModel < /code > to store each pixel component in a separate byte , short , or int .
39464	Sets the current position to index . The current position is indexed 0 to n-1 , that is , index zero corresponds to the first component . The operation returns true if the resulting current position indicates a component of the DynAny and false if index indicates a position that does not correspond to a component . Calling seek with a negative index is legal . It sets the current position to -1 to indicate no component and returns false . Passing a non-negative index value for a DynAny that does not have a component at the corresponding position sets the current position to -1 and returns false .
39465	Returns < tt > true < /tt > if this type of attribute is unknown . The default implementation of this method always returns < tt > true < /tt > .
39470	Relative read method for reading an integer value . Reads the next four bytes at this reader 's current position , composing them into an integer value according to big-endian byte order , and then increments the position by four .
39471	Implements InputStream.read ( int ) in terms of InputStream.read ( byte [ ] , int , int ) . InputStream assumes that you implement InputStream.read ( int ) and provides default implementations of the others , but often the opposite is more efficient .
39472	Returns the foo where uuid = & # 63 ; and groupId = & # 63 ; or returns < code > null < /code > if it could not be found . Uses the finder cache .
39481	Decode and return the specified URL-encoded String . When the byte array is converted to a string , the system default character encoding is used ... This may be different than some other servers . It is assumed the string is not a query string .
39482	Determines whether a composite name is a prefix of this composite name . A composite name ' n ' is a prefix if it is equal to getPrefix ( n.size ( ) ) -- in other words , this composite name starts with ' n ' . If ' n ' is null or not a composite name , false is returned .
39487	Returns < code > true < /code > if this < code > CompositeType < /code > instance defines an item whose name is < var > itemName < /var > .
39490	Returns whether this < code > DataFlavor < /code > is a valid text flavor for this implementation of the Java platform . Only flavors equivalent to < code > DataFlavor.stringFlavor < /code > and < code > DataFlavor < /code > s with a primary MIME type of `` text '' can be valid text flavors . < p > If this flavor supports the charset parameter , it must be equivalent to < code > DataFlavor.stringFlavor < /code > , or its representation must be < code > java.io.Reader < /code > , < code > java.lang.String < /code > , < code > java.nio.CharBuffer < /code > , < code > [ C < /code > , < code > java.io.InputStream < /code > , < code > java.nio.ByteBuffer < /code > , or < code > [ B < /code > . If the representation is < code > java.io.InputStream < /code > , < code > java.nio.ByteBuffer < /code > , or < code > [ B < /code > , then this flavor 's < code > charset < /code > parameter must be supported by this implementation of the Java platform . If a charset is not specified , then the platform default charset , which is always supported , is assumed . < p > If this flavor does not support the charset parameter , its representation must be < code > java.io.InputStream < /code > , < code > java.nio.ByteBuffer < /code > , or < code > [ B < /code > . < p > See < code > selectBestTextFlavor < /code > for a list of text flavors which support the charset parameter .
39498	Performs test to see if the specified attribute type is applicable to the specified TargetAttr . First a check if the TargetAttr parsing code saw an expression like : ( targetattrs= '' + || * '' ) , ( targetattrs ! = `` * || + '' ) where both shorthand tokens where parsed . IF so then the attribute type matches automatically ( or not matches if NOT_EQUALITY ) . If there is n't a match , then the method evalAttrType is called to further evaluate the attribute type and targetAttr combination .
39528	Fill the area for pre-layout . On the one hand , we layout current attached view and appearing views . On the other hand , we calculate the layout params for the real layout . And the stop criterion is calculated according the params .

39536	Uninitializes < code > this.list < /code > by calling < code > uninstallListeners ( ) < /code > , < code > uninstallKeyboardActions ( ) < /code > , and < code > uninstallDefaults ( ) < /code > in order . Sets this.list to null .
39537	Produces a method handle giving write access to a non-static field . The type of the method handle will have a void return type . The method handle will take two arguments , the instance containing the field , and the value to be stored . The second argument will be of the field 's value type . Access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class .
39539	In call and plug out earphone ( in onPause state ) , need to show no antenna dialog but use mIsNeedShowNoAntennaDlg to save the state , because there is no where to show this dialog after onResume ( ) for this case
39548	A restartable is any RxJava observable that can be started ( subscribed ) and should be automatically restarted ( re-subscribed ) after a process restart if it was still subscribed at the moment of saving presenter 's state . Registers a factory . Re-subscribes the restartable after the process restart .
39552	Returns a query expression that represents a matching constraint on a string argument . The matching syntax is consistent with file globbing : supports `` < code > ? < /code > '' , `` < code > * < /code > '' , `` < code > [ < /code > '' , each of which may be escaped with `` < code > \ < /code > '' ; character classes may use `` < code > ! < /code > '' for negation and `` < code > - < /code > '' for range . ( < code > * < /code > for any character sequence , < code > ? < /code > for a single arbitrary character , < code > [ ... ] < /code > for a character sequence ) . For example : < code > a*b ? c < /code > would match a string starting with the character < code > a < /code > , followed by any number of characters , followed by a < code > b < /code > , any single character , and a < code > c < /code > .
39562	Updates the configuration seen by this listener but should only be called when changes between the new handlerConfig and the only are limited to changes in the set of defined clients . Any other change requires that the listener be shutdown and possibly restarted .

39580	Sorts the specified array into ascending numerical order . < p > Implementation note : The sorting algorithm is a Dual-Pivot Quicksort by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy , Jon Bentley , and Joshua Bloch . This algorithm offers O ( n log ( n ) ) performance on many data sets that cause other quicksorts to degrade to quadratic performance , and is typically faster than traditional ( one-pivot ) Quicksort implementations .
39585	returns the first corner of this trace , which is the intersection of the first and second lines of its polyline It MUST return an int point otherwise I will notbe able to connect to a pin ! ! ! Well , it would be nice if it was that easy . not , unfortunately .
39588	Brings up a dialog where the number of choices is determined by the < code > optionType < /code > parameter , where the < code > messageType < /code > parameter determines the icon to display . The < code > messageType < /code > parameter is primarily used to supply a default icon from the Look and Feel .
39593	Returns the offset after the last character of the subsequence captured by the given group during the previous match operation . < p > < a href= '' Pattern.html # cg '' > Capturing groups < /a > are indexed from left to right , starting at one . Group zero denotes the entire pattern , so the expression < i > m. < /i > < tt > end ( 0 ) < /tt > is equivalent to < i > m. < /i > < tt > end ( ) < /tt > . < /p >
39595	Scans the next token of the input as an < tt > int < /tt > . < p > An invocation of this method of the form < tt > nextInt ( ) < /tt > behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation < tt > nextInt ( radix ) < /tt > , where < code > radix < /code > is the default radix of this scanner .
39610	Apply the given pattern to this Format object . A pattern is a short-hand specification for the various formatting properties . These properties can also be changed individually through the various setter methods . < p > There is no limit to integer digits set by this routine , since that is the typical end-user desire ; use setMaximumInteger if you want to set a real value . For negative numbers , use a second pattern , separated by a semicolon < P > Example < code > '' # , # 00.0 # '' < /code > & rarr ; 1,234.56 < P > This means a minimum of 2 integer digits , 1 fraction digit , and a maximum of 2 fraction digits . < p > Example : < code > '' # , # 00.0 # ; ( # , # 00.0 # ) '' < /code > for negatives in parentheses . < p > In negative patterns , the minimum and maximum counts are ignored ; these are presumed to be set in the positive pattern .
39619	Removes the default RDN prefix if this is a qualified name int the default namespace . IF not , it STAYS qualified . Configuring services with PIDs that are not qualified by org . or com . is currently not supported .
39632	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a list of Strings , one entry per line , using the default character encoding of the platform . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
39638	Adds one of the base DNs we must search for . If at least one baseDN is added using this method , only the added baseDNs are searched . If no base DN is added , all the base DNs will be retrieved .
39653	Invoked when a mouse button is pressed on a component and then dragged . Mouse drag events will continue to be delivered to the component where the first originated until the mouse button is released ( regardless of whether the mouse position is within the bounds of the component ) .
39664	Finds the class with the specified binary name . We search for a file in CLASS_PATH or pull an entry from DEX_FILE . If we do n't find a match , we throw an exception .

39697	Encodes the provided set of object classes to a byte array . If the same set had been previously encoded , then the cached value will be used . Otherwise , a new value will be created .
39704	Cause the socket connection to be released to the connection pool when it is no longer needed . If it is already unneeded , it will be pooled immediately . Otherwise the connection is held so that redirects can be handled by the same connection .
39711	Invalidates the layout along an axis . This happens automatically if the preferences have changed for any of the child views . In some cases the layout may need to be recalculated when the preferences have not changed . The layout can be marked as invalid by calling this method . The layout will be updated the next time the < code > setSize < /code > method is called on this view ( typically in paint ) .
39714	Should a navigation bar appear at the bottom of the screen in the current device configuration ? A navigation bar may appear on the right side of the screen in certain configurations .

39763	Creates a beveled border of the specified type , using brighter shades of the component 's current background color for highlighting , and darker shading for shadows . ( In a lowered border , shadows are on top and highlights are underneath . )
39766	Do not map this character into a space if : < ol > < li > trimming is desired and this was the leading char. < /li > < li > The last character was a space. < /li > < /ol >
39772	This method updates the naming table especially whenever a new server added/deleted into platform server list . Note that WebtopNaming maintains a reference to the namingTable Hashtable in this class , and thus state in this hash must be updated in-place , or else the reference in WebtopNaming will point to Hashtables with stale state . Note also that this update should preclude concurrent references to this Hashtable - thus the update will synchronize on the Hashtable reference itself , as this will exclude concurrent get operations on the Hashtable while state in the Hashtable is being updated .
39777	Creates an any value from a DynAny object . A copy of the TypeCode associated with the DynAny object is assigned to the resulting any . The value associated with the DynAny object is copied into the any .
39780	Skips over and discards < code > n < /code > bytes of data from the input stream . The < code > skip < /code > method may , for a variety of reasons , end up skipping over some smaller number of bytes , possibly < code > 0 < /code > . The actual number of bytes skipped is returned . < p > This method simply performs < code > in.skip ( n ) < /code > .
39791	Receive notification of the start of a Namespace mapping . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the start of each Namespace prefix scope ( such as storing the prefix mapping ) . < /p >
39793	Compares its two arguments for order . Returns a negative integer , zero , or a positive integer as the first argument is less than , equal to , or greater than the second .
39794	Returns true if newly created < code > JFrame < /code > s should have their Window decorations provided by the current look and feel . This is only a hint , as certain look and feels may not support this feature .
39809	Returns true if the specified character is valid . This method also checks the surrogate character range from 0x10000 to 0x10FFFF . < p > If the program chooses to apply the mask directly to the < code > CHARS < /code > array , then they are responsible for checking the surrogate character range .
39813	This method is intended to make the UserFolder to be visually identical in size and position to its associated FolderIcon . This allows for a seamless transition into the expanded state .
39816	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence ( from first to last element ) . < p > The returned array will be `` safe '' in that no references to it are maintained by this list . ( In other words , this method must allocate a new array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array . < p > This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs .
39829	Converts a JAXB object to a < code > String < /code > object and creates a < code > Map < /code > . The key is 'attrName ' and the value is a < code > Set < /code > which contains the < code > String < /code > object .
39840	Adds a title to an existing border , with the specified positioning and font , and using the default text color ( determined by the current look and feel ) .
39848	Receive notification of a recoverable parser error . < p > The default implementation does nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each error , such as inserting the message in a log file or printing it to the console. < /p >
39854	Clones the abstract action . This gives the clone its own copy of the key/value list , which is not handled for you by < code > Object.clone ( ) < /code > .
39856	This method tries to update the visibility of the steps panel . The contents are updated because the user clicked in one of the buttons that could make the steps panel to change .
39860	Prints warning messages only when debug level is greater than Debug.ERROR . < p > < b > NOTE : < /b > Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused . Particularly , note that Java evaluates arguments to < code > warning ( ) < /code > even when debugging is turned off . So when the argument to this method involves the String concatenation operator '+ ' or any other method invocation , < code > warningEnabled < /code > < b > MUST < /b > be used . It is recommended that the debug state be checked by invoking < code > warningEnabled ( ) < /code > before invoking any < code > warning ( ) < /code > methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and to maximize application performance. < /p >
39861	Creates a new font program . This font program can be one of the 14 built in fonts , a Type1 font referred to by an AFM or PFM file , a TrueType font ( simple or one from collection ) or a CJK font from the Adobe Asian Font Pack . TrueType fonts and CJK fonts can have an optional style modifier appended to the name . These modifiers are : Bold , Italic and BoldItalic . An example would be `` STSong-Light , Bold '' . Note that this modifiers do not work if the font is embedded . Fonts in TrueType Collections are addressed by index such as `` msgothic.ttc,1 '' . This would get the second font ( indexes start at 0 ) , in this case `` MS PGothic '' . < p/ > The fonts are cached and if they already exist they are extracted from the cache , not parsed again . < p/ >
39865	Emits an XML document representing all of the properties contained in this table . < p > An invocation of this method of the form < tt > props.storeToXML ( os , comment ) < /tt > behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation < tt > props.storeToXML ( os , comment , `` UTF-8 '' ) ; < /tt > .
39871	Compares this CompoundName with the specified Object for order . Returns a negative integer , zero , or a positive integer as this Name is less than , equal to , or greater than the given Object . < p > If obj is null or not an instance of CompoundName , ClassCastException is thrown . < p > See equals ( ) for what it means for two compound names to be equal . If two compound names are equal , 0 is returned . < p > Ordering of compound names depend on the syntax of the compound name . By default , they follow lexicographical rules for string comparison with the extension that this applies to all the components in the compound name and that comparison of individual components is affected by the jndi.syntax.ignorecase and jndi.syntax.trimblanks properties , identical to how they affect equals ( ) . If this compound name is `` lexicographically '' lesser than obj , a negative number is returned . If this compound name is `` lexicographically '' greater than obj , a positive number is returned . < p > Implementation note : Currently the syntax properties of the two compound names are not compared when checking order . They might be in the future .
39877	Returns a column given its name . Implementation is naive so this should be overridden if this method is to be called often . This method is not in the < code > TableModel < /code > interface and is not used by the < code > JTable < /code > .
39883	Modifies or replaces the task used to execute a callable . This method can be used to override the concrete class used for managing internal tasks . The default implementation simply returns the given task .
39887	Compares this string to the specified < code > String < /code > . The result is < code > true < /code > if and only if the argument is not < code > null < /code > and is a < code > String < /code > object that represents the same sequence of characters as this object .
39889	Attempts to read a substring of the specified length from the current position . The caller must ensure that the requested length is within the bounds i.e . the requested length from the current position should not exceed the length of the source string .
39894	Convenience method to copy from a byte buffer to a char buffer using provided decoder to decode bytes into characters . < p > It should not be used directly , prefer instance method of ByteString or ByteStringBuilder instead .
39895	Creates and returns an enumeration that traverses the subtree rooted at this node in depth-first order . The first node returned by the enumeration 's < code > nextElement ( ) < /code > method is the leftmost leaf . This is the same as a postorder traversal. < P > Modifying the tree by inserting , removing , or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification .
39900	Report a fatal XML parsing error . < p > The default implementation throws a SAXParseException . Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they need to take specific actions for each fatal error ( such as collecting all of the errors into a single report ) : in any case , the application must stop all regular processing when this method is invoked , since the document is no longer reliable , and the parser may no longer report parsing events. < /p >
39914	Removes any previous compression type and quality settings . < p > The default implementation sets the instance variable < code > compressionType < /code > to < code > null < /code > , and the instance variable < code > compressionQuality < /code > to < code > 1.0F < /code > .
39925	Reads an SQL < code > NCLOB < /code > value from the stream and returns it as a < code > Clob < /code > object in the Java programming language .
39927	Reads the next byte of data from this input stream . The value byte is returned as an < code > int < /code > in the range < code > 0 < /code > to < code > 255 < /code > . If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached , the value < code > -1 < /code > is returned . < p > This < code > read < /code > method can not block .
39954	Prints messages only when the stats state is either < code > Stats.FILE < /code > or < code > Stats.CONSOLE < /code > . < p > < b > NOTE : < /b > Printing Statistics is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused . Particularly , note that Java evaluates arguments to < code > message ( ) < /code > even when statistics is turned off . So when the argument to this method involves the String concatenation operator '+ ' or any other method invocation , < code > isEnabled < /code > < b > MUST < /b > be used . It is recommended that the stats state be checked by invoking < code > isEnabled ( ) < /code > before invoking any < code > message ( ) < /code > methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and maximize application performance . < /p >

39961	Encodes a string into its quoted-printable form using the default string charset . Unsafe characters are escaped . < p > This function implements a subset of quoted-printable encoding specification ( rule # 1 and rule # 2 ) as defined in RFC 1521 and is suitable for encoding binary data . < /p >
39971	Creates sunxmlkeyvalue files with the given values under the given directory . sunxmlkeyvalue files are created so searching for realms does not have to read in every attribute properrties file and look for the sunxmlkeyvalue attribute . we just need to look for sub directories with the sunxmlkeyvalue file .
39977	Creates sunserviceid files with the given values under the given directory . sunserviceid files are created so getting schemasubentries does not have to read in every attribute properrties file and look for the serviceid attribute . we just need to look for sub directories with the sunserviceid file .
39993	Computes the hash code of this compound name . The hash code is the sum of the hash codes of the `` canonicalized '' forms of individual components of this compound name . Each component is `` canonicalized '' according to the compound name 's syntax before its hash code is computed . For a case-insensitive name , for example , the uppercased form of a name has the same hash code as its lowercased equivalent .
39995	Generates the string representation of this modification item , which consists of the modification operation and its related attribute . The string representation is meant for debugging and not to be interpreted programmatically .
39998	IdKeyPattern : := 'id ' ' ( ' Literal ' ) ' | 'key ' ' ( ' Literal ' , ' Literal ' ) ' ( Also handle doc ( ) )
40009	Responds to a request for a TopDownLeftRight ( TDLR ) ordered resend of the pixel data from an < code > ImageConsumer < /code > . When an < code > ImageConsumer < /code > being fed by an instance of this < code > ImageFilter < /code > requests a resend of the data in TDLR order , the < code > FilteredImageSource < /code > invokes this method of the < code > ImageFilter < /code > . < p > An < code > ImageFilter < /code > subclass might override this method or not , depending on if and how it can send data in TDLR order . Three possibilities exist : < ul > < li > Do not override this method . This makes the subclass use the default implementation , which is to forward the request to the indicated < code > ImageProducer < /code > using this filter as the requesting < code > ImageConsumer < /code > . This behavior is appropriate if the filter can determine that it will forward the pixels in TDLR order if its upstream producer object sends them in TDLR order . < li > Override the method to simply send the data . This is appropriate if the filter can handle the request itself & # 151 ; for example , if the generated pixels have been saved in some sort of buffer . < li > Override the method to do nothing . This is appropriate if the filter can not produce filtered data in TDLR order . < /ul >
40016	Processes an internal bind operation with the provided information . Note that regardless of whether the bind is successful , the authentication state for this internal connection will not be altered in any way .

40069	Reverses configuration which was done on the specified component during < code > installUI < /code > . This method is invoked when this < code > UIComponent < /code > instance is being removed as the UI delegate for the specified component . This method should undo the configuration performed in < code > installUI < /code > , being careful to leave the < code > JComponent < /code > instance in a clean state ( no extraneous listeners , look-and-feel-specific property objects , etc. ) . This should include the following : < ol > < li > Remove any UI-set borders from the component . < li > Remove any UI-set layout managers on the component . < li > Remove any UI-added sub-components from the component . < li > Remove any UI-added event/property listeners from the component . < li > Remove any UI-installed keyboard UI from the component . < li > Nullify any allocated instance data objects to allow for GC . < /ol >
40071	Determines whether this LDAP name starts with a specified LDAP name prefix . A name < tt > n < /tt > is a prefix if it is equal to < tt > getPrefix ( n.size ( ) ) < /tt > -- in other words this LDAP name starts with ' n ' . If n is null or not a RFC2253 formatted name as described in the class description , false is returned .
40080	Compares this SessionID to the specified object . The result is true if and only if the argument is not null and the random string and server name are the same in both objects .
40083	Returns the last < code > UndoableEdit < /code > in < code > edits < /code > , or < code > null < /code > if < code > edits < /code > is empty .
40085	Processes any key events that the component itself recognizes . This is called after the focus manager and any interested listeners have been given a chance to steal away the event . This method is called only if the event has not yet been consumed . This method is called prior to the keyboard UI logic . < p > This method is implemented to do nothing . Subclasses would normally override this method if they process some key events themselves . If the event is processed , it should be consumed .
40096	Returns whether or not the supplied key event maps to a key that is used for navigation . This is used for optimizing key input by only passing non- navigation keys to the first letter navigation mechanism .
40104	Dismiss the fragment and its dialog . If the fragment was added to the back stack , all back stack state up to and including this entry will be popped . Otherwise , a new transaction will be committed to remove the fragment .

40127	Determines whether an SSL client with the provided certificate chain should be trusted . This implementation is not intended for server-side use , and therefore this method will always throw an exception .
40128	Attempt to recover from failure to connect via a route . Returns a new HTTP engine that should be used for the retry if there are other routes to try , or null if there are no more routes to try .
40135	This method returns the index within the calling String object of the last occurrence of the specified value , searching backwards from the offset . Returns -1 if the value is not found . The search starts from the end and case sensitive .
40148	Compares this CompositeName with the specified Object for order . Returns a negative integer , zero , or a positive integer as this Name is less than , equal to , or greater than the given Object . < p > If obj is null or not an instance of CompositeName , ClassCastException is thrown . < p > See equals ( ) for what it means for two composite names to be equal . If two composite names are equal , 0 is returned . < p > Ordering of composite names follows the lexicographical rules for string comparison , with the extension that this applies to all the components in the composite name . The effect is as if all the components were lined up in their specified ordered and the lexicographical rules applied over the two line-ups . If this composite name is `` lexicographically '' lesser than obj , a negative number is returned . If this composite name is `` lexicographically '' greater than obj , a positive number is returned .

40170	Append a child to the end of the child list of the current node . Please note that the node is always cloned if it is owned by another document . < p > % REVIEW % `` End of the document '' needs to be defined more clearly . Does it become the last child of the Document ? Of the root element ? < /p >
40171	Opens the entry container for a base DN . If the entry container does not exist for the base DN , it will be created . The entry container will be opened with the same mode as the root container . Any entry containers opened in a read only root container will also be read only . Any entry containers opened in a non transactional root container will also be non transactional .
40180	Returns the number of files currently being used to store the values in this cache . This may be greater than the max file count if a background deletion is pending .
40181	Checks if this FilePermission object `` implies '' the specified permission . < P > More specifically , this method returns true if : < ul > < li > < i > p < /i > is an instanceof FilePermission , < li > < i > p < /i > 's actions are a proper subset of this object 's actions , and < li > < i > p < /i > 's pathname is implied by this object 's pathname . For example , `` /tmp/* '' implies `` /tmp/foo '' , since `` /tmp/* '' encompasses all files in the `` /tmp '' directory , including the one named `` foo '' . < /ul >

40210	< p > Copy NodeList members into this nodelist , adding in document order . Only genuine node references will be copied ; nulls appearing in the source NodeSet will not be added to this one . < /p > < p > In case you 're wondering why this function is needed : NodeSet implements both NodeIterator and NodeList . If this method is n't provided , Java ca n't decide which of those to use when addNodes ( ) is invoked . Providing the more-explicit match avoids that ambiguity . ) < /p >
40223	Try 's to reset the super class and reset this class for re-use , so that you do n't need to create a new serializer ( mostly for performance reasons ) .
40224	Returns true if the union has no active member , that is , the unions value consists solely of its discriminator because the discriminator has a value that is not listed as an explicit case label . Calling this operation on a union that has a default case returns false . Calling this operation on a union that uses the entire range of discriminator values for explicit case labels returns false .
40227	Computes the child 's initial value for this inheritable thread-local variable as a function of the parent 's value at the time the child thread is created . This method is called from within the parent thread before the child is started . < p > This method merely returns its input argument , and should be overridden if a different behavior is desired .
40233	In a asymmetric binding , messages from server to client will be encrypted with the server 's public key , and thus he alias to the server 's private key entry must be specified .
40247	Appends a new padstack with the input shapes to this padstacks . p_shapes is an array of dimension board layer_count . p_attach_allowed indicates if vias of the own net are allowed to overlap with this padstack If p_placed_absolute is false , the layers of the padstack are mirrored , if it is placed on the back side .
40263	Tell if this node identity is a descendant . Assumes that the node info for the element has already been obtained . This one-sided test works only if the parent has been previously tested and is known to be a descendent . It fails if the parent is the _startNode 's next sibling , or indeed any node that follows _startNode in document order . That may suffice for this iterator , but it 's not really an isDescendent ( ) test . % REVIEW % rename ?

40354	Converts the float argument to an < code > int < /code > using the < code > floatToIntBits < /code > method in class < code > Float < /code > , and then writes that < code > int < /code > value to the underlying output stream as a 4-byte quantity , high byte first . If no exception is thrown , the counter < code > written < /code > is incremented by < code > 4 < /code > .
40358	Detaches the iterator from the set which it iterated over , releasing any computational resources and placing the iterator in the INVALID state . After < code > detach < /code > has been invoked , calls to < code > nextNode < /code > or < code > previousNode < /code > will raise the exception INVALID_STATE_ERR .

If not set , the org.forgerock.openam.sts.rest.token.provider.oidc.DefaultOpenIdConnectTokenAuthModeReferencesMapper will be used , which simply returns null .
40407	Gets whether you should show UI with rationale for requesting a permission . You should do this only if you do not have the permission and the context in which the permission is requested does not clearly communicate to the user what would be the benefit from granting this permission . < p > For example , if you write a camera app , requesting the camera permission would be expected by the user and no rationale for why it is requested is needed . If however , the app needs location for tagging photos then a non-tech savvy user may wonder how location is related to taking photos . In this case you may choose to show UI with rationale of requesting this permission . < /p >
40416	Answer the contents of this StringWriter as a String . Any changes made to the StringBuffer by the receiver after returning will not be reflected in the String returned to the caller .
40426	Returns the position in this < code > SerialClob < /code > object where the given < code > Clob < /code > signature begins , starting the search at the specified position . This method returns < code > -1 < /code > if the pattern is not found .

40448	Computes key.hashCode ( ) and spreads ( XORs ) higher bits of hash to lower . Because the table uses power-of-two masking , sets of hashes that vary only in bits above the current mask will always collide . ( Among known examples are sets of Float keys holding consecutive whole numbers in small tables . ) So we apply a transform that spreads the impact of higher bits downward . There is a tradeoff between speed , utility , and quality of bit-spreading . Because many common sets of hashes are already reasonably distributed ( so do n't benefit from spreading ) , and because we use trees to handle large sets of collisions in bins , we just XOR some shifted bits in the cheapest possible way to reduce systematic lossage , as well as to incorporate impact of the highest bits that would otherwise never be used in index calculations because of table bounds .
40455	Compare this RuleBasedCollationKey and the target for equality . The collation rules of the Collator object which created these keys are applied . < strong > Note : < /strong > RuleBasedCollationKeys created by different Collators can not be compared .

40567	This method is new in the DOM L3 for Attr interface . Could throw DOMException here , but its probably OK to always return false . One reason for this , is we have no good way to document this exception , since this class , IIOAttr , is not a public class . The rest of the methods that throw DOMException are publically documented as such on IIOMetadataNode .
40580	Creates a border with a raised beveled edge , using brighter shades of the component 's current background color for highlighting , and darker shading for shadows . ( In a raised border , highlights are on top and shadows are underneath . )
40582	Returns true if this node has no children . To distinguish between nodes that have no children and nodes that < i > can not < /i > have children ( e.g . to distinguish files from empty directories ) , use this method in conjunction with < code > getAllowsChildren < /code >

40622	Justify this layout . Overridden by subclassers to control justification ( if there were subclassers , that is ... ) The layout will only justify if the paragraph attributes ( from the source text , possibly defaulted by the layout attributes ) indicate a non-zero justification ratio . The text will be justified to the indicated width . The current implementation also adjusts hanging punctuation and trailing whitespace to overhang the justification width . Once justified , the layout may not be rejustified . < p > Some code may rely on immutablity of layouts . Subclassers should not call this directly , but instead should call getJustifiedLayout , which will call this method on a clone of this layout , preserving the original .
40625	Writes a < code > String < /code > in the Java programming language to this < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > object . The driver converts it to an SQL < code > CHAR < /code > , < code > VARCHAR < /code > , or < code > LONGVARCHAR < /code > before returning it to the database .
40633	Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present .

40654	Returns < code > true < /code > if this tag causes a line break to the flow of data , otherwise returns < code > false < /code > .
40660	Mark the present position in the stream . Subsequent calls to reset ( ) will attempt to reposition the stream to this point . Not all character-input streams support the mark ( ) operation .
40670	Checks for spam requests . If the caller is following protocol this method will return true . However if the call has been made too many times ( but not so many that it triggers a network level DOS block ) then it will throw an exception and the authentication module will fail . To avoid this failure pay attention to the wait timeout period returned in the callback object and ensure that this spam checker is
40676	Tests if this input stream supports the < code > mark < /code > and < code > reset < /code > methods . This method simply performs < code > in.markSupported ( ) < /code > .

The object is exported on an anonymous port , if < code > port < /code > is zero . < p > During activation , this < code > exportObject < /code > method should be invoked explicitly by an `` activatable '' object , that does not extend the < code > Activatable < /code > class . There is no need for objects that do extend the < code > Activatable < /code > class to invoke this method directly because the object is exported during construction .
40697	Register a relation definition with this managed object definition , overriding any existing relation definition with the same name . < p > This method < b > must not < /b > be called by applications .

40785	Writes a message to the access logger with information about the bind response associated with the provided bind operation . < p > The default implementation is to not log anything .
40792	Processes events on this scrolling list . If an event is an instance of < code > ItemEvent < /code > , it invokes the < code > processItemEvent < /code > method . Else , if the event is an instance of < code > ActionEvent < /code > , it invokes < code > processActionEvent < /code > . If the event is not an item event or an action event , it invokes < code > processEvent < /code > on the superclass . < p > Note that if the event parameter is < code > null < /code > the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception .
40793	Throws an < code > org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT < /code > exception with the message `` This is a locally constrained object . '' This method does not apply to local objects and is therefore not implemented . This method is the default implementation of the < code > org.omg.CORBA.Object < /code > method. < P >
40797	During login , callbacks are usually used to prompt for passwords . All of the GSSAPI login information is provided in the properties and login.conf file , so callbacks are ignored .

40808	Sequenced events are dispatched in order , so we can not dispatch until we are the first sequenced event in the queue ( i.e . it 's our turn ) . But while we wait for our turn to dispatch , the event could have been disposed for a number of reasons .
40814	Adds a new keymap into the keymap hierarchy . Keymap bindings resolve from bottom up so an attribute specified in a child will override an attribute specified in the parent .
40825	Returns true if lightweight ( all-Java ) < code > Tooltips < /code > are in use , or false if heavyweight ( native peer ) < code > Tooltips < /code > are being used .
40833	< p > Returns a shallow clone of this instance .

40903	Returns a writable channel on the given output stream . The resulting channel has following properties : < ul > < li > If the channel is closed , then the underlying stream is closed as well. < /li > < li > It is not buffered. < /li > < /ul >
40920	Compares the specified Object with this < code > LDAPPrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns < code > true < /code > if the given object is also a < code > LDAPPrincipal < /code > and the two < code > LDAPPrincipal < /code > s have the same user name .
40925	Retrieves the next attribute in this < code > SQLInputImpl < /code > object as a < code > short < /code > in the Java programming language . < P > This method does not perform type-safe checking to determine if the returned type is the expected type ; this responsibility is delegated to the UDT mapping as defined by a < code > SQLData < /code > implementation . < P >
40929	Returns sqrt ( < i > x < /i > < sup > 2 < /sup > & nbsp ; + < i > y < /i > < sup > 2 < /sup > ) without intermediate overflow or underflow . < p > Special cases : < ul > < li > If either argument is infinite , then the result is positive infinity . < li > If either argument is NaN and neither argument is infinite , then the result is NaN . < /ul > < p > The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result . If one parameter is held constant , the results must be semi-monotonic in the other parameter .
40930	Returns < code > true < /code > if the specified < code > TextHitInfo < /code > has the same < code > charIndex < /code > and < code > isLeadingEdge < /code > as this < code > TextHitInfo < /code > . This is not the same as having the same insertion offset .
40934	Returns an LDAP connection for the specified LDAP server using the provided LDAP options . The returned connection must be closed once the caller has completed its transaction . Connections are cached between calls using a connection pool . The LDAP options may be used for configuring SSL parameters and timeouts . < p > NOTE : if a connection has already been obtained to the specified LDAP server then a cached connection will be returned and the LDAP options will be ignored .
40937	Creates a new DynAny object whose value is a deep copy of the DynAny on which it is invoked . The operation is polymorphic , that is , invoking it on one of the types derived from DynAny , such as DynStruct , creates the derived type but returns its reference as the DynAny base type .
40941	Save an online store to the persistence layer . This is a so called ` upsert ` operation . This is used to update store info , or just apply for a new store .
40945	Registers the keyboard bindings on the < code > JList < /code > that the < code > BasicListUI < /code > is associated with . This method is called at installUI ( ) time .
40947	Returns a copy of this period with the specified days added . < p > This adds the amount to the days unit in a copy of this period . The years and months units are unaffected . For example , `` 1 year , 6 months and 3 days '' plus 2 days returns `` 1 year , 6 months and 5 days '' . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .
40953	Sleep until we can be sure that the time thread has been updated . Otherwise , password changes can all appear to be in the same millisecond and really weird things start to happen because of the way that we handle conflicts in password history timestamps . In short , if the history is already at the maximum count and all the previous changes occurred in the same millisecond as the new change , then it 's possible for a new change to come with a timestamp that is before the timestamps of all the existing values .
40957	Attempt to create an XML reader from a class name . < p > Given a class name , this method attempts to load and instantiate the class as an XML reader. < /p >
40966	Normally causes every selected item in the object to be selected if the object supports multiple selections . This method makes no sense in a menu bar , and so does nothing .
40967	Returns the the next significant edit to be redone if < code > redo < /code > is invoked . This returns < code > null < /code > if there are no edits to be redone .
40970	Requests that attribute values should be compared byte for byte , rather than using their matching rules . This is useful when a client wishes to perform trivial changes to an attribute value which would otherwise be ignored by the matching rule , such as removing extra white space from an attribute , or capitalizing a user 's name .
40971	Reads a single character from this reader and returns it as an integer with the two higher-order bytes set to 0 . Returns -1 if no more characters are available from this reader .
40972	Returns a BigInteger with the given two 's complement representation . Assumes that the input array will not be modified ( the returned BigInteger will reference the input array if feasible ) .
40985	Erase a purchase ( locally ) from the inventory , given its product ID . This just modifies the Inventory object locally and has no effect on the server ! This is useful when you have an existing Inventory object which you know to be up to date , and you have just consumed an item successfully , which means that erasing its purchase data from the Inventory you already have is quicker than querying for a new Inventory .
40986	Returns the next attribute in this < code > SQLInputImpl < /code > object as a stream of uninterpreted bytes . < P > This method does not perform type-safe checking to determine if the returned type is the expected type as this responsibility is delegated to the UDT mapping as implemented by a < code > SQLData < /code > implementation .
41001	Returns true if this URI is opaque . Opaque URIs are absolute and have a scheme-specific part that does not start with a slash character . All parts except scheme , scheme-specific and fragment are undefined .

41008	Receive notification of a skipped entity . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each processing instruction , such as setting status variables or invoking other methods. < /p >
41013	Resets this matcher with a new input sequence . < p > Resetting a matcher discards all of its explicit state information and sets its append position to zero . The matcher 's region is set to the default region , which is its entire character sequence . The anchoring and transparency of this matcher 's region boundaries are unaffected .
41020	Returns an < code > ImageTypeSpecifier < /code > that encodes one of the standard < code > BufferedImage < /code > types ( other than < code > TYPE_CUSTOM < /code > ) .
41026	Deletes a file , never throwing an exception . If file is a directory , delete it and all sub-directories . < p > The difference between File.delete ( ) and this method are : < ul > < li > A directory to be deleted does not have to be empty. < /li > < li > No exceptions are thrown when a file or directory can not be deleted. < /li > < /ul >
41027	Removes the child at the specified index from this node 's children and sets that node 's parent to null . The child node to remove must be a < code > MutableTreeNode < /code > .
41032	Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it . Once the stream has been closed , further read ( ) , ready ( ) , mark ( ) , reset ( ) , or skip ( ) invocations will throw an IOException . Closing a previously closed stream has no effect .
41036	Reads a single byte from the current position in this file and returns it as an integer in the range from 0 to 255 . Returns -1 if the end of the file has been reached . Blocks until one byte has been read , the end of the file is detected , or an exception is thrown .
41043	Check if the file has an invalid path . Currently , the inspection of a file path is very limited , and it only covers Nul character check . Returning true means the path is definitely invalid/garbage . But returning false does not guarantee that the path is valid .
41049	Creates a < code > KeyListener < /code > which will be added to the combo box . If this method returns null then it will not be added to the combo box .
41057	Publishes an event with details of the failed CREST operation , if the 'access ' topic is audited . < p/ > Any exception that occurs while trying to publish the audit event will be captured in the debug logs but otherwise ignored .

41122	Installs the < code > DefaultFormatter < /code > onto a particular < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > . This will invoke < code > valueToString < /code > to convert the current value from the < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > to a String . This will then install the < code > Action < /code > s from < code > getActions < /code > , the < code > DocumentFilter < /code > returned from < code > getDocumentFilter < /code > and the < code > NavigationFilter < /code > returned from < code > getNavigationFilter < /code > onto the < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > . < p > Subclasses will typically only need to override this if they wish to install additional listeners on the < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > . < p > If there is a < code > ParseException < /code > in converting the current value to a String , this will set the text to an empty String , and mark the < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > as being in an invalid state . < p > While this is a public method , this is typically only useful for subclassers of < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > . < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > will invoke this method at the appropriate times when the value changes , or its internal state changes .
41130	Interactively prompts ( on error output ) the user to provide a string value . Any non-empty string will be allowed ( the empty string will indicate that the default should be used , if there is one ) .
41133	Remove a PropertyChangeListener for a specific property . If < code > listener < /code > was added more than once to the same event source for the specified property , it will be notified one less time after being removed . If < code > propertyName < /code > is null , no exception is thrown and no action is taken . If < code > listener < /code > is null , or was never added for the specified property , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .

41177	< strong > ANDROID INTERPOLATOR < /strong > < br/ > < br/ > An interpolator where the change starts backward then flings forward and overshoots the target value and finally goes back to the final value .
41179	Requests that the argument string be displayed in the `` status window '' . Many browsers and applet viewers provide such a window , where the application can inform users of its current state .
41195	Generate a tag for a FROM header or TO header . Just return a random 4 digit integer ( should be enough to avoid any clashes ! ) Tags only need to be unique within a call .
41199	Returns the number of components of a DynAny . For a DynAny without components , it returns zero . The operation only counts the components at the top level . For example , if component_count is invoked on a DynStruct with a single member , the return value is 1 , irrespective of the type of the member . < UL > < LI > For sequences , the operation returns the current number of elements . < LI > For structures , exceptions , and value types , the operation returns the number of members . < LI > For arrays , the operation returns the number of elements . < LI > For unions , the operation returns 2 if the discriminator indicates that a named member is active , otherwise , it returns 1 . < LI > For DynFixed and DynEnum , the operation returns zero . < /UL >

41217	Iterates over all active threads in this group ( and its sub-groups ) and stores the threads in the given array . Returns when the array is full or no more threads remain , whichever happens first . < p > Note that this method will silently ignore any threads that do n't fit in the supplied array .
41220	Method that can be called to choose different root type ( of types defined in protoc ) ; a new schema instance will be constructed if type is different from current root type . < p > Note that cost of changing root type is non-trivial in that traversal of types defined is needed -- but exact cost depends on number of types defined . Since schema instances are immutable , it makes sense to try to reuse instances if possible .
41221	Repaints the specified rectangle of this component within < code > time < /code > milliseconds . Refer to < code > RepaintManager < /code > for details on how the repaint is handled .
41232	Check if the provided entry contains the provided object class . < p > The provided object class must be recognized by the provided schema , otherwise the method returns false .

41250	Flushes this output stream by forcing any buffered output bytes that have already been processed by the encapsulated cipher object to be written out . < p > Any bytes buffered by the encapsulated cipher and waiting to be processed by it will not be written out . For example , if the encapsulated cipher is a block cipher , and the total number of bytes written using one of the < code > write < /code > methods is less than the cipher 's block size , no bytes will be written out .
41255	Adds the organization names to the list of organization names that can import this service configutation . If one does not exist it will be created . The organization names must be fully qualified , starting with a forward slash `` / '' . To specify an entire sub-tree that can use the service configuration , a `` * '' would have to be appended after the final forward slash . For example `` /a/b/c/* '' would imply all sub-organization under `` /a/b/c '' can use this service configuration . Exporting implies privileges to read the service configuration data and not to modify or delete .
41262	Initialize the defaults table with the name of the ResourceBundle used for getting localized defaults . Also initialize the default locale used when no locale is passed into UIDefaults.get ( ) . The default locale should generally not be relied upon . It is here for compatibility with releases prior to 1.4 .
41263	Checks if the subject is exclusive . If subject is exclusive , policy applies to users who are not members of the subject . Otherwise , policy applies to members of the subject . The policy will apply to a user if he is a member of any normal ( non exclusive ) subject in the policy or not a member of any exclusive subject in the policy .
41287	Creates an integer suitable for hash table indexing. < p > The hash code is based upon all the URL components relevant for URL comparison . As such , this operation is a blocking operation. < p >
41289	Submits completed callbacks ( from the just-completed step - the first time this is called realCallbacks should be null as there is no just-completed step in the internal auth module ) , and injects the next lot if there are any .
41290	Sets the current position to index . The current position is indexed 0 to n-1 , that is , index zero corresponds to the first component . The operation returns true if the resulting current position indicates a component of the DynAny and false if index indicates a position that does not correspond to a component . Calling seek with a negative index is legal . It sets the current position to -1 to indicate no component and returns false . Passing a non-negative index value for a DynAny that does not have a component at the corresponding position sets the current position to -1 and returns false .

41410	Serializes this < code > DragGestureEvent < /code > . Performs default serialization and then writes out this object 's < code > List < /code > of gesture events if and only if the < code > List < /code > can be serialized . If not , < code > null < /code > is written instead . In this case , a < code > DragGestureEvent < /code > created from the resulting deserialized stream will contain an empty < code > List < /code > of gesture events .
41420	Ensures that this entry does not contain the provided attribute values . If the provided attribute is empty , then all values of the associated attribute type will be removed . Otherwise , only the specified values will be removed . < p > This method handles object class deletions . < p > This method implements LDAP modification delete semantics .

41561	Indicates that the XMLReader object is no longer in use for the transform . Note that the getXMLReader method may return an XMLReader that was specified on the SAXSource object by the application code . Such a reader should still be passed to releaseXMLReader , but the reader manager will only re-use XMLReaders that it created .
41563	Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content . < p > Validating Parsers must use this method to report each chunk of ignorable whitespace ( see the W3C XML 1.0 recommendation , section 2.10 ) : non-validating parsers may also use this method if they are capable of parsing and using content models. < /p > < p > SAX parsers may return all contiguous whitespace in a single chunk , or they may split it into several chunks ; however , all of the characters in any single event must come from the same external entity , so that the Locator provides useful information. < /p > < p > The application must not attempt to read from the array outside of the specified range. < /p >
41571	Creates a mouse motion listener that watches for mouse motion events in the popup 's list . If this method returns null then it will not be added to the combo box .
41589	This method allows to do the necessary computing for the window management after treatment by the worker threads . This should be called once the replay thread have done their job and the window can be open again .
41595	Write a single character . The character to be written is contained in the 16 low-order bits of the given integer value ; the 16 high-order bits are ignored . < p > Subclasses that intend to support efficient single-character output should override this method .
41599	Receive notification of an unparsed entity declaration . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to keep track of the unparsed entities declared in a document. < /p >
41600	Adds path to the current selection . If path is not currently in the selection the TreeSelectionListeners are notified . This has no effect if < code > path < /code > is null .
41617	Searches for people containers in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of people containers with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
41623	Ends any input composition that may currently be going on in this context . Depending on the platform and possibly user preferences , this may commit or delete uncommitted text . Any changes to the text are communicated to the active component using an input method event . If no input methods are available , then this method has no effect . < p > A text editing component may call this in a variety of situations , for example , when the user moves the insertion point within the text ( but outside the composed text ) , or when the component 's text is saved to a file or copied to the clipboard .

41637	Returns all objects of class TreeEntry , which overlap with p_shape on layer p_layer inclusive clearance p_clearance_class is the index in the clearance matrix , which describes the required clearance restrictions to other items . If p_layer < 0 , the layer is ignored . This seems one of the main point for the logic , finding out if something overlaps , damiano The code is actually correct since the logic is somewhat inverted , meaning that if `` the system '' uses by itself clearance compensation you do not have to use a `` specilized '' method to do the search with clearance ...
41642	Searches for all roles in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of all roles with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .

41673	Creates and returns an enumeration that traverses the subtree rooted at this node in preorder . The first node returned by the enumeration 's < code > nextElement ( ) < /code > method is this node. < P > Modifying the tree by inserting , removing , or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification .
41674	Removes the given connection from the list of connections to be closed when idle . This will return true if the connection is still valid , and false if the connection should be considered expired and not used .
41679	Calls hasNext ( ) and returnes the prepared node . Afterwards its set to null . The existance of returnProperty indicates if there is a next node , otherwise an exceptio is thrown .

41696	Updates the value of the an attribute identified by the given name . If this attribute is not present , the value is added to the attribute list at the end of the already present attributes . Note that it is not possible to add an attribute in the middle of the attribute list if already certain other attributes are present . One way to work around this limitation is to remove all attributes from this element and then add them in the required order as necessary .
41697	Start a drag , given the < code > DragGestureEvent < /code > that initiated the drag , the initial < code > Cursor < /code > to use , the < code > Image < /code > to drag , the offset of the < code > Image < /code > origin from the hotspot of the < code > Cursor < /code > at the instant of the trigger , the subject data of the drag , and the < code > DragSourceListener < /code > . < P >

41758	Because we do n't have simple versions , we 're masking the creation of RichVersions by creating empty NodeVersions . This is a bad hack that requires us creating a Node for each NodeVersion , but tests right now are small . Eventually , if we mock a database , we can avoid this .
41771	Converts the given number to its English alphabet string representation . E.g . for < code > upperCase < /code > set to false , 1 will be converted to `` a '' , 2 to `` b '' , ... , 27 to `` aa '' , and so on .
41778	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to an < code > OutputStream < /code > line by line , using the default character encoding of the platform and the specified line ending .
41779	Searches for dynamic groups in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of dynamic groups with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
41786	Converts this abstract pathname into a < code > file : < /code > URL . The exact form of the URL is system-dependent . If it can be determined that the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a directory , then the resulting URL will end with a slash .
41788	Returns < code > true < /code > if the standard metadata format is among the document formats recognized by the < code > getAsTree < /code > and < code > setFromTree < /code > methods on the image metadata objects produced or consumed by this plug-in .
41789	To generate new Secret Block ( which generates yolo image by default ) element in stage . The generated element must be added into < b > SpriteHandler < /b > class 's < em > STAGE_ELEMENTS < /em > list and to the < em > stageContainer < /em > .
41791	The implementation first checks to see if an expression with this value has already been written . If not , the expression is cloned , using the same procedure as < code > writeStatement < /code > , and the value of this expression is reconciled with the value of the cloned expression by calling < code > writeObject < /code > .
41827	This sets the user object of the TreeNode identified by path and posts a node changed . If you use custom user objects in the TreeModel you 're going to need to subclass this and set the user object of the changed node to something meaningful .
41838	Returns a copy of the info with a new character that represents the decimal point . < p > The character used to represent a decimal point may vary by culture . This method specifies the character to use .
41841	Return the index of the first character with a different baseline from the character at start , or limit if all characters between start and limit have the same baseline .
41850	Paints a component to the specified < code > Graphics < /code > . This method is primarily useful to render < code > Component < /code > s that do n't exist as part of the visible containment hierarchy , but are used for rendering . For example , if you are doing your own rendering and want to render some text ( or even HTML ) , you could make use of < code > JLabel < /code > 's text rendering support and have it paint directly by way of this method , without adding the label to the visible containment hierarchy . < p > This method makes use of < code > CellRendererPane < /code > to handle the actual painting , and is only recommended if you use one component for rendering . If you make use of multiple components to handle the rendering , as < code > JTable < /code > does , use < code > CellRendererPane < /code > directly . Otherwise , as described below , you could end up with a < code > CellRendererPane < /code > per < code > Component < /code > . < p > If < code > c < /code > 's parent is not a < code > CellRendererPane < /code > , a new < code > CellRendererPane < /code > is created , < code > c < /code > is added to it , and the < code > CellRendererPane < /code > is added to < code > p < /code > . If < code > c < /code > 's parent is a < code > CellRendererPane < /code > and the < code > CellRendererPane < /code > s parent is not < code > p < /code > , it is added to < code > p < /code > . < p > The component should either descend from < code > JComponent < /code > or be another kind of lightweight component . A lightweight component is one whose `` lightweight '' property ( returned by the < code > Component < /code > < code > isLightweight < /code > method ) is true . If the Component is not lightweight , bad things map happen : crashes , exceptions , painting problems ...
41852	Inverts the direction of this.middle , if start_point ( ) has a bigger x coordinate than end_point ( ) , or an equal x coordinate and a bigger y coordinate .
41869	Returns a string representation of this JCheckBoxMenuItem . This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes , and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations . The returned string may be empty but may not be < code > null < /code > .
41873	Checks if server instance identified by serverID is the primary server for this OpenAM server 's site . How this check is performed varies depending on whether or not this server is running as part of a site : - If a site is running , the primary server details refer to the site 's primary server ( usu . load balancer ) . - If a site has n't been setup , then the primary server details will match the local server details .
41879	Perform the query using the provided TokenStorageAdapter . The ResultHandler is able to receive a return type of either Tokens or PartialTokens and so the value passed to the ResultHandler will depend on the kind of query requested .
41881	Detect if the root cause of the exception is an index constraint violation This is necessary as the database may wrap this root cause in further exceptions , masking the underlying cause
41889	Convert a Java encoding name to MIME charset name . Available values of < i > encoding < /i > are `` UTF8 '' , `` 8859_1 '' , `` 8859_2 '' , `` 8859_3 '' , `` 8859_4 '' , `` 8859_5 '' , `` 8859_6 '' , `` 8859_7 '' , `` 8859_8 '' , `` 8859_9 '' , `` JIS '' , `` SJIS '' , `` EUCJIS '' , `` GB2312 '' , `` BIG5 '' , `` KSC5601 '' , `` ISO2022KR '' , `` KOI8_R '' , `` CP037 '' , `` CP277 '' , `` CP278 '' , `` CP280 '' , `` CP284 '' , `` CP285 '' , `` CP297 '' , `` CP420 '' , `` CP424 '' , `` CP500 '' , `` CP870 '' , `` CP871 '' and `` CP918 '' .
41910	This method is used primarily at the client side to reconstruct a ResponseSet object based on the XML document received from server . The DTD of this XML document is described above .
41918	This redirects to the script editor . This is n't a natural thing for JATO , and so the strategy used here is to set up a redirect and then throw a CompleteRequestException ( thus pretending an error occurred ) which causes the redirect to happen .
41925	Choose an alias to authenticate the client side of a secure socket given the public key type and the list of certificate issuer authorities recognized by the peer ( if any ) .
41926	Produces a method handle giving write access to elements of an array . The type of the method handle will have a void return type . Its last argument will be the array 's element type . The first and second arguments will be the array type and int .
41940	Returns the collected javax.sip.TimeoutEvent or null if no event has been collected . After this method is called the SipEventCollector will remove itself from the corresponding javax.sip.SipProvider and reset its internal state so that it could be reused .
41945	Tests whether the file named by this abstract pathname is a hidden file . The exact definition of < em > hidden < /em > is system-dependent . On UNIX systems , a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with a period character ( < code > '. ' < /code > ) . On Microsoft Windows systems , a file is considered to be hidden if it has been marked as such in the filesystem .
41953	Creates an unmodifiable CRAM MD5 SASL bind request of the provided request . < p > The returned bind request creates defensive copies of the password in order to maintain immutability .
41955	Ask whether we support a given DOM feature . In fact , we do not _fully_ support any DOM feature -- we 're a read-only subset -- so arguably we should always return false .
41963	Returns the number of components of a DynAny . For a DynAny without components , it returns zero . The operation only counts the components at the top level . For example , if component_count is invoked on a DynStruct with a single member , the return value is 1 , irrespective of the type of the member . < UL > < LI > For sequences , the operation returns the current number of elements . < LI > For structures , exceptions , and value types , the operation returns the number of members . < LI > For arrays , the operation returns the number of elements . < LI > For unions , the operation returns 2 if the discriminator indicates that a named member is active , otherwise , it returns 1 . < LI > For DynFixed and DynEnum , the operation returns zero . < /UL >
41969	Sorts the specified array into ascending numerical order . < p > Implementation note : The sorting algorithm is a Dual-Pivot Quicksort by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy , Jon Bentley , and Joshua Bloch . This algorithm offers O ( n log ( n ) ) performance on many data sets that cause other quicksorts to degrade to quadratic performance , and is typically faster than traditional ( one-pivot ) Quicksort implementations .
41970	Replaces an existing subject with the same name by the current one . If a subject with the same name does not exist , it will be added . The subject is replaced as a normal ( non exclusive ) subject . So , policy will apply to members of the subject . The policy will apply to a user if he is a member of any normal ( non exclusive ) subject subject in the policy or not a member of any exclusive subject subject in the policy .
41992	Writes a < code > Clob < /code > object in the Java programming language to this < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > object . The driver converts it to a serializable < code > SerialClob < /code > SQL < code > CLOB < /code > value before returning it to the database .
42001	Initialize the cache . This will include reading the journal files from the storage and building up the necessary in-memory cache information . < p > The initialization time may vary depending on the journal file size and the current actual cache size . The application needs to be aware of calling this function during the initialization phase and preferably in a background worker thread . < p > Note that if the application chooses to not call this method to initialize the cache . By default , the okhttp will perform lazy initialization upon the first usage of the cache .
42011	Creates a new entry change notification response control with the provided change type and optional previous distinguished name and change number . The previous distinguished name , if provided , will be decoded using the default schema .
42024	Returns a hash code value for this set-of-integer attribute . The hash code is the sum of the lower and upper bounds of the ranges in the canonical array form , or 0 for an empty set .
42042	Marks the current position in this input stream . < p > The < code > mark < /code > method of < code > InflaterInputStream < /code > does nothing .
42048	Generates encoded session id string which uses the same extensions and tail part as prototype session id , but a different encrypted ID . This method is used to generate session handle and restricted token id for a given master session id . Related session IDs must share extensions and tail information in order for session failover to work properly
42049	Receive notification of character data inside an element . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method to take specific actions for each chunk of character data ( such as adding the data to a node or buffer , or printing it to a file ) . < /p >
42088	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to the specified < code > File < /code > line by line . The default VM encoding and the default line ending will be used .
42090	Returns the default group container name created when an organization is created in OpenAM . This may not be the one which the user sees as his/her default container through the OpenAM console .
42091	Moves to the start of the next line , offset from the start of the current line . < p/ > As a side effect , this sets the leading parameter in the text state. < /P >
42097	Queries whether any threads have ever contended to acquire this synchronizer ; that is if an acquire method has ever blocked . < p > In this implementation , this operation returns in constant time .
42105	Throws an < code > org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT < /code > exception with the message `` This is a locally constrained object . '' This method is the default implementation of the < code > org.omg.CORBA.Object < /code > method. < P >
42109	Return true if only container entries are displayed . An entry is a container if : - it has some children - or its class is one of the container classes specified with setContainerClasses ( ) .
42120	Paints the icon . The real paint behavior occurs naturally from the association that the icon has with its parent container ( the same container hosting this view ) , so this simply allows us to position the icon properly relative to the view . Since the coordinate system for the view is simply the parent containers , positioning the child icon is easy .
42123	Get the contents of a < code > Reader < /code > as a character array . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > .
42132	Adds a value to the set of values for this argument . This should only be called if the value is allowed by the < CODE > valueIsAcceptable < /CODE > method . Note that in this case , correct behavior depends on a previous successful call to < CODE > valueIsAcceptable < /CODE > so that the value read from the file may be stored in the name-to-value hash and used in place of the filename here .
42136	Returns a copy of this duration with the specified duration in hours subtracted . < p > The number of hours is multiplied by 3600 to obtain the number of seconds to subtract . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .
42151	Has all of the request body been read ? There are subtle differences between this and available ( ) & gt ; 0 primarily because of having to handle faking non-blocking reads with the blocking IO connector .
42159	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
42163	Creates and returns a < code > PropertyChangeListener < /code > that is responsible for listening for changes from the specified < code > Action < /code > and updating the appropriate properties . < p > < b > Warning : < /b > If you subclass this do not create an anonymous inner class . If you do the lifetime of the textfield will be tied to that of the < code > Action < /code > .
42169	Generates a valid ASCII property list in GnuStep format which has this NSDictionary as its root object . The generated property list complies with the format as described in < a href= '' http : //www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/Developer/Base/Reference/NSPropertyList.html '' > GnuStep - NSPropertyListSerialization class documentation < /a >
42172	Determines whether or not the value starts with a silent letter . It will return < code > true < /code > if the value starts with any of 'GN ' , 'KN ' , 'PN ' , 'WR ' or 'PS ' .
42181	Receive notification of the start of an element . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the start of each element ( such as allocating a new tree node or writing output to a file ) . < /p >
42184	Checks the specified value 's type is valid for this < tt > TabularData < /tt > instance ( ie value is not null , and its composite type is equal to row type ) .
42195	Checks whether two filenames are equal using the case rules of the system . < p > No processing is performed on the filenames other than comparison . The check is case-sensitive on Unix and case-insensitive on Windows .
42201	Read data from the input buffer and put it into a byte chunk . The buffer is owned by the protocol implementation - it will be reused on the next read . The Adapter must either process the data in place or copy it to a separate buffer if it needs to hold it . In most cases this is done during byte- & gt ; char conversions or via InputStream . Unlike InputStream , this interface allows the app to process data in place , without copy .
42203	Processes window events occurring on this component . Hides the window or disposes of it , as specified by the setting of the < code > defaultCloseOperation < /code > property .
42208	Revokes previous registration for the activation descriptor associated with < code > id < /code > . An object can no longer be activated via that < code > id < /code > .
42214	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
42220	Prints error messages only if debug state is greater than Debug.OFF . If the debug file is not accessible and debugging is enabled , the message along with a time stamp and thread info will be printed on < code > System.out < /code > . < /p > < p > This method creates the debug file if does not exist ; otherwise it starts appending to the existing debug file . When invoked for the first time on this object , the method writes a line delimiter of '*'s. < /p > < p > Note that the debug file will remain open until < code > destroy ( ) < /code > is invoked . To conserve file resources , you should invoke < code > destroy ( ) < /code > explicitly rather than wait for the garbage collector to clean up. < /p >
42231	Execute a periodic task , such as reloading , etc . This method will be invoked inside the classloading context of this container . Unexpected throwables will be caught and logged .
42248	Creates a single sign on token from the single sign on token ID . Note : -If you want to do Client 's IP address validation for the single sign on token then use < code > creatSSOToken ( String , String ) < /code > OR < code > createSSOToken ( HttpServletRequest ) < /code > .
42259	Adds an element to this small set or replaces the existing element 's value with the provided one . < p > The replacement aspect is useful when the small set uses a `` normalized '' value to compare elements for equality but stores them as an `` actual '' value .
42261	Binds a name to an object . All intermediate contexts and the target context ( that named by all but terminal atomic component of the name ) must already exist .
42265	Writes the specified < code > byte < /code > to this output stream . < p > The < code > write < /code > method of < code > FilterOutputStream < /code > calls the < code > write < /code > method of its underlying output stream , that is , it performs < tt > out.write ( b ) < /tt > . < p > Implements the abstract < tt > write < /tt > method of < tt > OutputStream < /tt > .
42276	< p > The clock sequence value of the version 1 , variant 2 UUID as per < a href= '' http : //www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt '' > RFC 4122 < /a > .
42280	< strong > ANDROID INTERPOLATOR < /strong > < br/ > < br/ > Repeats the animation for a specified number of cycles . The rate of change follows a sinusoidal pattern .
42288	Returns the next available character , or the null character '\0 ' if all input has been exhausted . The return value of this method is ambiguous for JSON strings that contain the character '\0 ' .
42299	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue . The returned array elements are in no particular order . < p > The returned array will be `` safe '' in that no references to it are maintained by this queue . ( In other words , this method must allocate a new array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array . < p > This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs .
42302	Notification from the < code > UIManager < /code > that the L & amp ; F has changed . Replaces the current UI object with the latest version from the < code > UIManager < /code > .
42303	Reset this Namespace support object for reuse . < p > It is necessary to invoke this method before reusing the Namespace support object for a new session . If namespace declaration URIs are to be supported , that flag must also be set to a non-default value . < /p >
42316	Performs any post-add processing required by this constraint . This method is invoked after a new managed object has been accepted for use by the administration framework . This might occur during initialization or when a managed object is added at run-time . < p > The default implementation is to do nothing .
42325	Performs a JAXRPC method call . The parameter < code > functionName < /code > is the JAXRPC function to be called with parameter < code > param < /code > . Returns an object on success , else throws an < code > Exception < /code > .
42329	Attempts to match any players with the given name , and returns a list of all possibly matches . < p > This list is not sorted in any particular order . If an exact match is found , the returned list will only contain a single result .
42333	Dispatches the given JSP parse error to the configured error handler . The given error code is localized . If it is not found in the resource bundle for localized error messages , it is used as the error message .
42343	Resolve an external entity . < p > Always return null , so that the parser will use the system identifier provided in the XML document . This method implements the SAX default behaviour : application writers can override it in a subclass to do special translations such as catalog lookups or URI redirection. < /p >
42346	Tests if the thread associated with this < tt > ThreadInfo < /tt > is executing native code via the Java Native Interface ( JNI ) . The JNI native code does not include the virtual machine support code or the compiled native code generated by the virtual machine .
42352	Replace the ServerState of the provided baseDN with the provided server state . The provided server state will be owned by this instance , so care must be taken by calling code to duplicate it if needed .
42353	Atomically removes all of the elements from this delay queue . The queue will be empty after this call returns . Elements with an unexpired delay are not waited for ; they are simply discarded from the queue .
42363	Deregisters the provided OID as a supported control for the Directory Server . This will have no effect if the specified control OID is not present in the list of supported controls .
42374	Binds a name to an object , overwriting any existing binding . All intermediate contexts and the target context ( that named by all but terminal atomic component of the name ) must already exist . < p > If the object is a DirContext , any existing attributes associated with the name are replaced with those of the object . Otherwise , any existing attributes associated with the name remain unchanged .
42375	Update the ring color if this is within the last 25 % of the animation . The new ring color will be a translation from the starting ring color to the next color .
42376	Retrieves the < code > CLOB < /code > value at the head of this < code > SQLInputImpl < /code > object as a < code > Clob < /code > object in the Java programming language . < P > This method does not perform type-safe checking to determine if the returned type is the expected type as this responsibility is delegated to the UDT mapping as implemented by a < code > SQLData < /code > implementation .
42387	Creates a new entry for the given key , value , hash , and index and inserts it into the hash table . This method is called by put ( and indirectly , putAll ) , and overridden by LinkedHashMap . The hash must incorporate the secondary hash function .
42426	Determines whether an ImageConsumer is on the list of consumers currently interested in data for this image . < p > This method is public as a side effect of this class implementing the < code > ImageProducer < /code > interface . It should not be called from user code , and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified .
42436	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
42437	Writes the currently edited board design to a text file in the Specctra dsn format . If p_compat_mode is true , only standard speecctra dsn scopes are written , so that any host system with an specctra interface can read them .
42443	Marks the Connection as closed , and notifies the pool that the pooled connection is available . In accordance with the JDBC specification this Connection can not be used after closed ( ) is called . Any further usage will result in an SQLException .
42444	Marks as invalid ( or valid depending on the value of the invalid parameter ) a field corresponding to FieldName . This basically implies udpating the style of the JLabel associated with fieldName ( the association is done using the LabelFieldDescriptor class ) .
42453	Indicates whether this client connection is currently using a secure mechanism to communicate with the server . Note that this may change over time based on operations performed by the client or server ( e.g. , it may go from < CODE > false < /CODE > to < CODE > true < /CODE > if the client uses the StartTLS extended operation ) .
42455	The given domain name can match one or none domain names supported by Issuers declared in this route . If the given domain name matches the patterns given by an Issuer 'supportedDomains ' attributes , then the corresponding Issuer is returned to be used .
42456	Searches for an object in the array . If it is found its index will be returned . This method only returns the index of an object that is < b > identical < /b > to the given one . Thus objects that might contain the same value as the given one will not be considered .
42457	In this scenario , the fake RS will send back an ack after NO_TIMEOUT_RS_SLEEP_TIME seconds , so we expect the add/delete entry code ( LDAP client code emulation ) to be blocked for more than NO_TIMEOUT_RS_SLEEP_TIME seconds but no more than the timeout value .
42467	Returns the character at position < tt > pos < /tt > from the matched text . It is equivalent to yytext ( ) .charAt ( pos ) , but faster
42470	< p > Are fatal messages currently enabled ? < /p > < p > This allows expensive operations such as < code > String < /code > concatenation to be avoided when the message will be ignored by the logger . < /p >
42486	< b > Asynchronous tasks should never access any API in Bukkit . Great care should be taken to assure the thread-safety of asynchronous tasks. < /b > < p > Schedules this to repeatedly run asynchronously until cancelled , starting after the specified number of server ticks .
42492	Decrypts or de-obfuscates a string . Will decrypt if string is appended with 'CRYPT : ' and will de-obfuscate if string is appended with 'OBF : ' . If neither prefix is present , will return the same value . Will return null if encrypted is null or encountered an error .
42510	Compares this < code > JapaneseImperialCalendar < /code > to the specified < code > Object < /code > . The result is < code > true < /code > if and only if the argument is a < code > JapaneseImperialCalendar < /code > object that represents the same time value ( millisecond offset from the < a href= '' Calendar.html # Epoch '' > Epoch < /a > ) under the same < code > Calendar < /code > parameters .
42511	Calculates the number of times that this tokenizer 's < code > nextToken < /code > method can be called before it generates an exception . The current position is not advanced .
42520	Sets the key-value pair in the Internal Session property table . This method should only be invoked locally by code running in the same server VM . Remote invocations should use putExternalProperty ( ) . This is a simple wrapper around internalPutProperty ( ) , which in addition calls to registerProtectedProperty ( ) to make sure that if a property key is not already on the list of protected properties , it will be automatically added there ( unless it is also on remotelyUpdateableProperties list ! )
42533	< p > Subclasses of this class may override , or envelope , this method to add validation behavior for the BeanContext to examine child objects immediately prior to their being removed from the BeanContext . < /p >
42541	Obtains a local date in Japanese calendar system from the proleptic-year , month-of-year and day-of-month fields . < p > The Japanese proleptic year , month and day-of-month are the same as those in the ISO calendar system . They are not reset when the era changes .
42546	Adds a new style into the logical style hierarchy . Style attributes resolve from bottom up so an attribute specified in a child will override an attribute specified in the parent .
42549	Creates an unmodifiable digest MD5 SASL bind request of the provided request . < p > The returned bind request creates defensive copies of the password in order to maintain immutability .
42567	For compilation support , we need the option of overwriting ( rather than appending to ) previous composition . We could phase out the old API in favor of this one , but I 'm holding off until we 've made up our minds about compilation . ADDED 9/5/2000 to support compilation experiment . NOTE : GLP 29-Nov-00 I 've left this method in so that CompilingStylesheetHandler will compile . However , I 'm not sure why it 's needed or what it does and I 've commented out the body .
42577	Since the document a link is associated with may have changed , this method returns whether this Link is valid anymore ( with respect to the document it references ) .
42593	Execute a periodic task , such as reloading , etc . This method will be invoked inside the classloading context of this container . Unexpected throwables will be caught and logged .
42604	String representation of this < code > DataFlavor < /code > and its parameters . The resulting < code > String < /code > contains the name of the < code > DataFlavor < /code > class , this flavor 's MIME type , and its representation class . If this flavor has a primary MIME type of `` text '' , supports the charset parameter , and has an encoded representation , the flavor 's charset is also included . See < code > selectBestTextFlavor < /code > for a list of text flavors which support the charset parameter .
42611	Removes the specified attribute from this attribute set if present . If < CODE > attribute < /CODE > is null , then < CODE > remove ( ) < /CODE > does nothing and returns < tt > false < /tt > .
42620	Note that this operation has been somewhat deoptimized by the shift to a chunked array , as there is no factory method to produce a String object directly from an array of arrays and hence a double copy is needed . By using ensureCapacity we hope to minimize the heap overhead of building the intermediate StringBuffer . < p > ( It really is a pity that Java did n't design String as a final subclass of MutableString , rather than having StringBuffer be a separate hierarchy . We 'd avoid a < strong > lot < /strong > of double-buffering . )
42622	Push the RTFDTM 's context mark , to allows discarding RTFs added after this point . ( If it does n't exist we do n't push , since we might still be able to get away with not creating it . That requires that excessive pops be harmless . )
42678	Checks if this PropertyPermission object `` implies '' the specified permission . < P > More specifically , this method returns true if : < ul > < li > < i > p < /i > is an instanceof PropertyPermission , < li > < i > p < /i > 's actions are a subset of this object 's actions , and < li > < i > p < /i > 's name is implied by this object 's name . For example , `` java . * '' implies `` java.home '' . < /ul >
42684	Performs a JAXRPC method call . The parameter < code > functionName < /code > is the JAXRPC function to be called with parameters < code > params < /code > . Returns an object on success , else throws an < code > Exception < /code > .
42689	Reads an unsigned big-endian 16-bit short from the current position in this file and returns it as an integer . Blocks until two bytes have been read , the end of the file is reached or an exception is thrown .
42695	Decodes Base64 data into octets . < p > < b > Note : < /b > this method seamlessly handles data encoded in URL-safe or normal mode . < /p >
42699	Clearing the cache will remove all cached mappings between JWT and SessionID . This may be required in the event of configuration changes which should mean that a JWT is no longer valid . E.g . Changes in Signing Shared Secret .
42701	Visits the end of the field . This method , which is the last one to be called , is used to inform the visitor that all the annotations and attributes of the field have been visited .
42712	Checks to see if this is an HTTP request that includes a valid upgrade request to web socket . < p > Note : RFC 2616 does not limit HTTP upgrade to GET requests but the Java WebSocket spec 1.0 , section 8.2 implies such a limitation and RFC 6455 section 4.1 requires that a WebSocket Upgrade uses GET .
42740	Adds the specified component to the layout , using the specified constraint object . For border layouts , the constraint must be one of the following constants : < code > NORTH < /code > , < code > SOUTH < /code > , < code > EAST < /code > , < code > WEST < /code > , or < code > CENTER < /code > . < p > Most applications do not call this method directly . This method is called when a component is added to a container using the < code > Container.add < /code > method with the same argument types .
42754	Registers < code > listener < /code > so that it will receive < code > AncestorEvents < /code > when it or any of its ancestors move or are made visible or invisible . Events are also sent when the component or its ancestors are added or removed from the containment hierarchy .
42755	Removes the specified component from the container . If < code > comp < /code > is not the < code > rootPane < /code > , this will forward the call to the < code > contentPane < /code > . This will do nothing if < code > comp < /code > is not a child of the < code > JFrame < /code > or < code > contentPane < /code > .
42772	Returns a SOAP request compliant with JAXRPC for the provide function name < code > function < /code > that takes the parameter < code > param < /code > as the only argument .
42774	Rolls back the worker thread creation . - removes worker from workers , if present - decrements worker count - rechecks for termination , in case the existence of this worker was holding up termination
42777	Saves the principals successfully created in the authentication process whether all modules or identity searches are successful or not . This differs from the principalList which is generated by the logincontext as that is only generated when all modules have been completed successfully .
42795	Receive notification of a processing instruction . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each processing instruction , such as setting status variables or invoking other methods. < /p >
42800	Compare this RuleBasedCollationKey to target . The collation rules of the Collator object which created these keys are applied . < strong > Note : < /strong > RuleBasedCollationKeys created by different Collators can not be compared .
42804	Determines if the glyphs should have a strikethrough line . If true , a line should be drawn through the center of the glyphs . This is implemented to return the cached < code > strikeThrough < /code > property . < p > When you request this property , < code > LabelView < /code > re-syncs its state with the properties of the < code > Element < /code > 's < code > AttributeSet < /code > . If < code > Element < /code > 's < code > AttributeSet < /code > does not have this property set , it will revert to false .
42813	Removes multiple instances of an ingredient from the list . If there are less instances then specified , all will be removed . If the data value is -1 , only ingredients with a -1 data value will be removed .
42819	Removes references to the rules in < code > ss < /code > . < code > index < /code > gives the index the StyleSheet was at , that is how many StyleSheets had been added before it .
42829	Try 's to reset the super class and reset this class for re-use , so that you do n't need to create a new serializer ( mostly for performance reasons ) .
42834	Receive notification of a notation declaration . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they wish to keep track of the notations declared in a document. < /p >
42843	See the general contract of the < code > readUnsignedShort < /code > method of < code > DataInput < /code > . < p > Bytes for this operation are read from the contained input stream .
42857	Returns the length of the month represented by this date . < p > This returns the length of the month in days . Month lengths match those of the ISO calendar system .
42858	Gets the magnitude of the vector , defined as sqrt ( x^2+y^2+z^2 ) . The value of this method is not cached and uses a costly square-root function , so do not repeatedly call this method to get the vector 's magnitude . NaN will be returned if the inner result of the sqrt ( ) function overflows , which will be caused if the length is too long .
42874	Reads a single byte from the source byte array and returns it as an integer in the range from 0 to 255 . Returns -1 if the end of the source array has been reached .
42875	Creates a new wildcard ContactHeader . This is used in Register requests to indicate to the server that it should remove all locations the at which the user is currently available . This implies that the following conditions are met : < ul > < li > < code > ContactHeader.getAddress.getAddress.getUserInfo ( ) == * ; < /code > < li > < code > ContactHeader.getAddress.getAddress.isWildCard ( ) == true ; < /code > < li > < code > ContactHeader.getExpires ( ) == 0 ; < /code > < /ul >
42880	Constructs a string representation of this InetSocketAddress . This String is constructed by calling toString ( ) on the InetAddress and concatenating the port number ( with a colon ) . If the address is unresolved then the part before the colon will only contain the hostname .
42885	Writes an < code > java.sql.Type.DATALINK < /code > object in the Java programming language to this < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > object . The driver converts this value to a serializable < code > SerialDatalink < /code > SQL < code > DATALINK < /code > value before return it to the database .
42893	Returns an iterator object that lets you iterate over all elements of the set . This is the equivalent to < code > objectEnumerator < /code > in the Cocoa implementation of NSSet .
42897	Closes this < code > MemoryCacheImageOutputStream < /code > . All pending data is flushed to the output , and the cache is released . The destination < code > OutputStream < /code > is not closed .
42898	Produces a method handle giving read access to a static field . The type of the method handle will have a return type of the field 's value type . The method handle will take no arguments . Access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class . < p > If the returned method handle is invoked , the field 's class will be initialized , if it has not already been initialized .
42913	Render the view using the given allocation and rendering surface . < p > This is implemented to determine whether or not the desired region to be rendered ( i.e . the unclipped area ) is up to date or not . If up-to-date the children are rendered . If not up-to-date , a task to build the desired area is placed on the layout queue as a high priority task . This keeps by event thread moving by rendering if ready , and postponing until a later time if not ready ( since paint requests can be rescheduled ) .
42922	This method is used primarily at the server side to reconstruct a < code > AuthXMLRequest < /code > object based on the XML document received from client . The DTD of this XML document is described above .
42928	Does the servlet class represented by this component implement the < code > SingleThreadModel < /code > interface ? This can only be determined once the class is loaded . Calling this method will not trigger loading the class since that may cause the application to behave unexpectedly .
42935	Use onSizeChanged instead of onAttachedToWindow to get the dimensions of the view , because this method is called after measuring the dimensions of MATCH_PARENT WRAP_CONTENT . Use this dimensions to setup the bounds and paints .
42943	Compares two DynAny values for equality . Two DynAny values are equal if their TypeCodes are equivalent and , recursively , all component DynAnys have equal values . The current position of the two DynAnys being compared has no effect on the result of equal .
42948	Writes a message to the access logger with information about the modify DN request associated with the provided modify DN operation . < p > The default implementation is to not log anything .
42954	Initializes a property to be used by OpenAM . Ideally this must be called first before any other method is called within OpenAM . This method provides a programmatic way to set a specific property , and will override similar property if loaded for a properties file .
42977	Returns the encoded URL , rewritten to include the session id . cookie will be rewritten in the URL as a query string with entity escaping of ampersand before appending session ID if other query parameters exists in the URL . < p >
43001	Performs SSL handshake , non blocking , but performs NEED_TASK on the same thread . Hence , you should never call this method using your Acceptor thread , as you would slow down your system significantly . < p > The return for this operation is 0 if the handshake is complete and a positive value if it is not complete . In the event of a positive value coming back , the appropriate read/write will already have been called with an appropriate CompletionHandler .
43014	Remove a VetoableChangeListener from the listener list . This removes a VetoableChangeListener that was registered for all properties . If < code > listener < /code > was added more than once to the same event source , it will be notified one less time after being removed . If < code > listener < /code > is null , or was never added , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .
43020	Checks the purge historical subcommand options and updates the provided LocalizableMessageBuilder with the errors that were encountered with the subcommand options . This method assumes that the method parseArguments for the parser has already been called .
43030	Compares two DynAny values for equality . Two DynAny values are equal if their TypeCodes are equivalent and , recursively , all component DynAnys have equal values . The current position of the two DynAnys being compared has no effect on the result of equal .
43036	Inserts a row at < code > row < /code > in the model . The new row will contain < code > null < /code > values unless < code > rowData < /code > is specified . Notification of the row being added will be generated .

43055	Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output bytes to be written out to the stream . < p > The < code > flush < /code > method of < code > FilterOutputStream < /code > calls the < code > flush < /code > method of its underlying output stream .
43058	Increments the iterator 's index by one and returns the character at the new index . If the resulting index is greater or equal to getEndIndex ( ) , the current index is reset to getEndIndex ( ) and a value of DONE is returned .
43075	Execute the fallback elements . This must be explicitly called to instantiate the content of an xsl : fallback element . When an XSLT transformer performs fallback for an instruction element , if the instruction element has one or more xsl : fallback children , then the content of each of the xsl : fallback children must be instantiated in sequence ; otherwise , an error must be signaled . The content of an xsl : fallback element is a template .
43093	Copy all of the mappings from the specified map to this one . These mappings replace any mappings that this map had for any of the keys currently in the specified Map .
43102	Revert to the previous Namespace context . < p > Normally , you should pop the context at the end of each XML element . After popping the context , all Namespace prefix mappings that were previously in force are restored. < /p > < p > You must not attempt to declare additional Namespace prefixes after popping a context , unless you push another context first. < /p >
43106	For performance reasons , we would like not to acquire a lock in hasNext in the common case . To allow for this , we only access fields ( i.e . nextItem ) that are not modified by update operations triggered by queue modifications .
43107	Sieve a single set of multiples out of the sieve . Begin to remove multiples of the specified step starting at the specified start index , up to the specified limit .
43115	Creates a new strategy for multi-buffering on this component with the required buffer capabilities . This is useful , for example , if only accelerated memory or page flipping is desired ( as specified by the buffer capabilities ) . < p > Each time this method is called , the existing buffer strategy for this component is discarded .
43122	Puts the value into Image XObject dictionary and associates it with the specified key . If the key is already present , it will override the old value with the specified one .
43130	Throws an < code > org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT < /code > exception with the message `` This is a locally constrained object . '' This method is the default implementation of the < code > org.omg.CORBA.Object < /code > method. < P >

43164	Returns the trigonometric cosine of an angle . Special cases : < ul > < li > If the argument is NaN or an infinity , then the result is NaN. < /ul > < p > The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result . Results must be semi-monotonic .
43177	Relative read method for reading a compacted int value . Compaction allows to reduce number of bytes needed to hold int types depending on its value ( i.e : if value < 128 , value will be encoded using one byte only ) . Reads the next bytes at this reader 's current position , composing them into an int value according to big-endian byte order , and then increments the position by the size of the encoded int .
43182	Returns true if the request contains conditions that save the server from sending a response that the client has locally . When a request is enqueued with its own conditions , the built-in response cache wo n't be used .
43187	Write one or more lines with the description of the argument . We will indent the description five characters and try our best to wrap at or before column 79 so it will be friendly to 80-column displays . < p > FIXME consider merging with com.forgerock.opendj.cli.Utils # wrapText ( String , int , int )
43204	Creates a < code > PropertyChangeListener < /code > which will be added to the combo box . If this method returns null then it will not be added to the combo box .
43214	Compares this UUID with the specified UUID . < p > The first of two UUIDs is greater than the second if the most significant field in which the UUIDs differ is greater for the first UUID .
43217	Start the login process for the < code > AuthContextLocal < /code > object identified by the index type and index name . The < code > IndexType < /code > defines the possible kinds of `` objects '' or `` resources '' for which an authentication can be performed . Currently supported index types are users , roles , services ( or application ) , levels and mechanism .
43218	Queries whether any threads have ever contended to acquire this synchronizer ; that is if an acquire method has ever blocked . < p > In this implementation , this operation returns in constant time .
43229	Brings up an internal dialog panel with the options < i > Yes < /i > , < i > No < /i > and < i > Cancel < /i > ; with the title , < b > Select an Option < /b > .
43242	< code > readObject < /code > for custom serialization . < p > This method reads this object 's serialized form for this class as follows : < p > This method first invokes < code > defaultReadObject < /code > on the specified object input stream , and if < code > options < /code > is < code > null < /code > , then < code > options < /code > is set to a zero-length array of < code > String < /code > .
43252	Renders using the given rendering surface and area on that surface . This is implemented to load the zone if its not already loaded , and then perform the superclass behavior .
43254	Adds a listener to the list that is notified each time a change to the model occurs . The source of < code > ChangeEvents < /code > delivered to < code > ChangeListeners < /code > will be this < code > JSpinner < /code > . Note also that replacing the model will not affect listeners added directly to JSpinner . Applications can add listeners to the model directly . In that case is that the source of the event would be the < code > SpinnerModel < /code > .
43256	Returns whether this printer make and model attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class PrinterMakeAndModel . < LI > This printer make and model attribute 's underlying string and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's underlying string are equal . < LI > This printer make and model attribute 's locale and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's locale are equal . < /OL >
43257	Called for each MIME type string to give < code > DataFlavor < /code > subtypes the opportunity to change how the normalization of MIME types is accomplished . One possible use would be to add default parameter/value pairs in cases where none are present in the MIME type string passed in . This method is never invoked by this implementation from 1.1 onwards .
43259	Throws < code > CannotRedoException < /code > if < code > canRedo < /code > returns false . Sets < code > hasBeenDone < /code > to < code > true < /code > . Subclasses should override to redo the operation represented by this edit . Override should begin with a call to super .

43288	Returns a copy of this duration with the specified duration in minutes subtracted . < p > The number of hours is multiplied by 60 to obtain the number of seconds to subtract . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .
43303	Converts the given number to its English alphabet lowercase string representation . E.g . 1 will be converted to `` A '' , 2 to `` B '' , ... , 27 to `` AA '' , and so on .
43305	Detaches the iterator from the set which it iterated over , releasing any computational resources and placing the iterator in the INVALID state . After < code > detach < /code > has been invoked , calls to < code > nextNode < /code > or < code > previousNode < /code > will raise the exception INVALID_STATE_ERR . < p > This operation is a no-op in NodeSetDTM , and will not cause INVALID_STATE_ERR to be raised by later operations . < /p >
43313	Returns the successor of p , or the head node if p.next has been linked to self , which will only be true if traversing with a stale pointer that is now off the list .
43315	Checks whether the extension of the filename is that specified . < p > This method obtains the extension as the textual part of the filename after the last dot . There must be no directory separator after the dot . The extension check is case-sensitive on all platforms .
43322	Do not use . Use createTemporaryDirectory instead . Used by frameworks/base unit tests to clean up a temporary directory . Deliberately ignores errors , on the assumption that test cleanup is only supposed to be best-effort .
43323	Receive notification of a recoverable parser error . < p > The default implementation does nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each error , such as inserting the message in a log file or printing it to the console. < /p >
43343	Records an 'access ' audit event before and after the filtered CREST resource receives an read request . If the 'before ' audit event fails due to an error , the request is cancelled and an error response is returned . If the 'after ' audit event fails due to an error , the request is not cancelled as it 's affects may have already been applied .
43348	Creates a new < code > MultiPixelPackedSampleModel < /code > with the specified width and height . The new < code > MultiPixelPackedSampleModel < /code > has the same storage data type and number of bits per pixel as this < code > MultiPixelPackedSampleModel < /code > .
43366	Receive notification of the start of a Namespace mapping . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the start of each Namespace prefix scope ( such as storing the prefix mapping ) . < /p >
43367	Indicates whether the user may use a grace login if the password is expired and there is at least one grace login remaining . Note that this does not check to see if the user 's password is expired , does not verify that there are any remaining grace logins , and does not update the set of grace login times .
43386	Removes the < code > Referral < /code > object identified by object 's < code > equals < /code > method . If a Referral instance does not exist , the method will return silently .
43399	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque in proper sequence ( from first to last element ) . < p > The returned array will be `` safe '' in that no references to it are maintained by this deque . ( In other words , this method must allocate a new array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array . < p > This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs .
43407	Support for reporting bound property changes for boolean properties . This method can be called when a bound property has changed and it will send the appropriate PropertyChangeEvent to any registered PropertyChangeListeners .
43429	Processes action events occurring on this component by dispatching them to any registered < code > ActionListener < /code > objects . < p > This method is not called unless action events are enabled for this component . Action events are enabled when one of the following occurs : < ul > < li > An < code > ActionListener < /code > object is registered via < code > addActionListener < /code > . < li > Action events are enabled via < code > enableEvents < /code > . < /ul > < p > Note that if the event parameter is < code > null < /code > the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception .
43435	Returns a string representation of this < code > JMenuItem < /code > . This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes , and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations . The returned string may be empty but may not be < code > null < /code > .
43447	< p > Subclasses can override this method to insert their own subclass of Child without having to override add ( ) or the other Collection methods that add children to the set . < /p >
43449	Reads a big-endian 64-bit long from the current position in this file . Blocks until eight bytes have been read , the end of the file is reached or an exception is thrown .
43466	Exhaust an input stream , reading until EOF has been encountered . < p > Note that this function is intended as a non-public utility . This is a little weird , but it seemed silly to make a utility class for this one function , so instead it is just static and shared that way. < /p >
43475	The < tt > isLocal < /tt > method has the same semantics as the < tt > ObjectImpl._is_local < /tt > method , except that it can throw a < tt > RemoteException < /tt > . The < tt > _is_local ( ) < /tt > method is provided so that stubs may determine if a particular object is implemented by a local servant and hence local invocation APIs may be used .
43477	Pushes the < code > value < /code > to the editor if we are to commit on edits . If < code > value < /code > is null , the current value will be obtained from the text component .
43483	This method is called when we detected that there is something installed we inform of this to the user and the user wants to proceed with the installation destroying the contents of the data and the configuration in the current installation .
43486	Compare two byte arrays , by the order of their tags , as defined in ITU-T X.680 , sec . 6.4 . ( First compare tag classes , then tag numbers , ignoring the constructivity bit . )
43489	Adds a set of a given value to a map . Set will not be added if < code > attrMap < /code > is null or < code > value < /code > is null or < code > key < /code > is null .
43508	Should a navigation bar appear at the bottom of the screen in the current device configuration ? A navigation bar may appear on the right side of the screen in certain configurations .
43533	Determines the lowest ( rightmost ) bit of the specified long value that is 1 and returns the bit mask value for that bit . This is also referred to as the Least Significant 1 Bit . Returns zero if the specified long is zero .
43534	Compares this string to the specified object . The result is < code > true < /code > if and only if the argument is not < code > null < /code > and is a < code > String < /code > object that represents the same sequence of characters as this object .
43539	Manipulates the map once available . This callback is triggered when the map is ready to be used . This is where we can add markers or lines , add listeners or move the camera . In this case , we just add a marker near Sydney , Australia . If Google Play services is not installed on the device , the user will be prompted to install it inside the SupportMapFragment . This method will only be triggered once the user has installed Google Play services and returned to the app .
43552	If a descendant of this < code > JRootPane < /code > calls < code > revalidate < /code > , validate from here on down . < p > Deferred requests to layout a component and its descendents again . For example , calls to < code > revalidate < /code > , are pushed upwards to either a < code > JRootPane < /code > or a < code > JScrollPane < /code > because both classes override < code > isValidateRoot < /code > to return true .
43555	Returns a DsmlValue ( Object ) from an LDAP ByteString . The conversion is simplistic - try and convert it to UTF-8 and if that fails return a byte [ ] .
43558	Creates a new titled border with the specified title , the default border type ( determined by the current look and feel ) , the default text position ( determined by the current look and feel ) , the default justification ( leading ) , and the default font and text color ( determined by the current look and feel ) .
43564	Returns true if the specified character is valid and permitted outside of a character reference . That is , this method will return false for the same set as isXML11Valid , except it also reports false for `` control characters '' .
43574	Destroys the named context and removes it from the namespace . Any attributes associated with the name are also removed . Intermediate contexts are not destroyed . < p > This method is idempotent . It succeeds even if the terminal atomic name is not bound in the target context , but throws NameNotFoundException if any of the intermediate contexts do not exist . In a federated naming system , a context from one naming system may be bound to a name in another . One can subsequently look up and perform operations on the foreign context using a composite name . However , an attempt destroy the context using this composite name will fail with NotContextException , because the foreign context is not a `` subcontext '' of the context in which it is bound . Instead , use unbind ( ) to remove the binding of the foreign context . Destroying the foreign context requires that the destroySubcontext ( ) be performed on a context from the foreign context 's `` native '' naming system .
43577	Returns the `` no-prompt '' boolean argument . < br > < i > N.B : the ' n ' short option is also used by backendid , newGroupName , newPassword , no-prompt. < /i >
43583	Closes this context . This method releases this context 's resources immediately , instead of waiting for them to be released automatically by the garbage collector . This method is idempotent : invoking it on a context that has already been closed has no effect . Invoking any other method on a closed context is not allowed , and results in undefined behaviour .
43594	Reads up to < code > len < /code > bytes of data from this input stream into an array of bytes . If < code > len < /code > is not zero , the method blocks until some input is available ; otherwise , no bytes are read and < code > 0 < /code > is returned . < p > This method simply performs < code > in.read ( b , off , len ) < /code > and returns the result .
43596	Open a replicationServer session to the local ReplicationServer . The generation is read from the replicationDomain object . If it does not exist , take the 'empty backend ' generationID .
43597	Returns whether this pages per minute attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class PagesPerMinute . < LI > This pages per minute attribute 's value and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's value are equal . < /OL >
43603	Determines whether this LDAP name ends with a specified LDAP name suffix . A name < tt > n < /tt > is a suffix if it is equal to < tt > getSuffix ( size ( ) -n.size ( ) ) < /tt > -- in other words this LDAP name ends with ' n ' . If n is null or not a RFC2253 formatted name as described in the class description , false is returned .
43613	Writes a byte array to a file creating the file if it does not exist . < p > NOTE : As from v1.3 , the parent directories of the file will be created if they do not exist .
43616	Creates and returns a new parentless < code > JDialog < /code > with the specified title . The returned < code > JDialog < /code > will not be resizable by the user , however programs can invoke < code > setResizable < /code > on the < code > JDialog < /code > instance to change this property . The returned < code > JDialog < /code > will be set up such that once it is closed , or the user clicks on one of the buttons , the optionpane 's value property will be set accordingly and the dialog will be closed . Each time the dialog is made visible , it will reset the option pane 's value property to < code > JOptionPane.UNINITIALIZED_VALUE < /code > to ensure the user 's subsequent action closes the dialog properly .
43624	Generates a valid ASCII property list in GnuStep format which has this NSArray as its root object . The generated property list complies with the format as described in < a href= '' http : //www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/Developer/Base/Reference/NSPropertyList.html '' > GnuStep - NSPropertyListSerialization class documentation < /a >
43636	Increases the capacity of this < tt > ArrayList < /tt > instance , if necessary , to ensure that it can hold at least the number of elements specified by the minimum capacity argument .
43641	Forward the DocumentEvent to the given child view . This is implemented to reparent the child to the logical view ( the children may have been parented by a row in the flow if they fit without breaking ) and then execute the superclass behavior .
43657	Creates a < code > PropertyChangeListener < /code > that can be added to the JSpinner itself . Typically , this listener will call replaceEditor when the `` editor '' property changes , since it 's the < code > SpinnerUI 's < /code > responsibility to add the editor to the JSpinner ( and remove the old one ) . This method is called by < code > installListeners < /code > .
43660	Clears all of the current parameter values in this < code > RowSet < /code > object 's internal representation of the parameters to be set in this < code > RowSet < /code > object 's command when it is executed . < P > In general , parameter values remain in force for repeated use in this < code > RowSet < /code > object 's command . Setting a parameter value with the setter methods automatically clears the value of the designated parameter and replaces it with the new specified value . < P > This method is called internally by the < code > setCommand < /code > method to clear all of the parameters set for the previous command . < P > Furthermore , this method differs from the < code > initParams < /code > method in that it maintains the schema of the < code > RowSet < /code > object .
43677	Disable predictive animations . There is a bug in RecyclerView which causes views that are being reloaded to pull invalid ViewHolders from the internal recycler stack if the adapter size has decreased since the ViewHolder was recycled .
43679	Creates a new AccessToken using the information contained in an Intent populated by the Facebook application in order to launch a native link . For more information on native linking , please see https : //developers.facebook.com/docs/mobile/android/deep_linking/ .

43708	Prints warning messages only when debug level is greater than Debug.ERROR . < p/ > < p > < b > NOTE : < /b > Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused . Particularly , note that Java evaluates arguments to < code > warning ( ) < /code > even when debugging is turned off . It is recommended that the debug state be checked by invoking < code > warningEnabled ( ) < /code > before invoking any < code > warning ( ) < /code > methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and to maximize application performance . < /p > < p/ > < p > If the debug file is not accessible and debugging is enabled , the message along with a time stamp and thread info will be printed on < code > System.out < /code > . < /p > < p/ > < p > This method creates the debug file if does not exist ; otherwise it starts appending to the existing debug file . When invoked for the first time on this object , the method writes a line delimiter of '* 's . < /p > < p/ > < p > Note that the debug file will remain open until < code > destroy ( ) < /code > is invoked . To conserve file resources , you should invoke < code > destroy ( ) < /code > explicitly rather than wait for the garbage collector to clean up . < /p >
43720	Returns the next token if it matches the pattern constructed from the specified string . If the match is successful , the scanner advances past the input that matched the pattern . < p > An invocation of this method of the form < tt > next ( pattern ) < /tt > behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation < tt > next ( Pattern.compile ( pattern ) ) < /tt > .
43730	Ensures that the node in the specified row is collapsed . < p > If < code > row < /code > is & lt ; 0 or & gt ; = < code > getRowCount < /code > this will have no effect .
43733	If there is a security manager , makes sure caller has permission to shut down threads in general ( see shutdownPerm ) . If this passes , additionally makes sure the caller is allowed to interrupt each worker thread . This might not be true even if first check passed , if the SecurityManager treats some threads specially .
43746	Removes an ingredient from the list . If the ingredient occurs multiple times , only one instance of it is removed . Only removes exact matches , with a data value of 0 .
43750	verify that the given certificate successfully handles and confirms the signature associated with this signer and , if a signingTime attribute is available , that the certificate was valid at the time the signature was generated .
43761	Compares the specified Object with this < code > ApplicationPrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns < code > true < /code > if the given object is also a < code > ApplicationPrincipal < /code > and the two ApplicationPrincipals have the same user name .
43775	Copy on write for the internal tables in this context . < p > This class is optimized for the normal case where most elements do not contain Namespace declarations . In that case , the Context2 will share data structures with its parent . New tables are obtained only when new declarations are issued , so they can be popped off the stack. < /p > < p > JJK : **** Alternative : each Context2 might declare _only_ its local bindings , and delegate upward if not found. < /p >
43781	Add a single component to the identifier . The given component is added to the end of the identifier . Duplicate instances are not added -- only one instance of a component will exist in the identifier .
43799	A single preview frame will be returned to the handler supplied . The data will arrive as byte [ ] in the message.obj field , with width and height encoded as message.arg1 and message.arg2 , respectively .
43813	Returns < tt > true < /tt > if this map contains no key-value mappings . This result is a snapshot , and may not reflect unprocessed entries that will be removed before next attempted access because they are no longer referenced .
43826	Writes a < code > short < /code > in the Java programming language to this < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > object . The driver converts it to an SQL < code > SMALLINT < /code > before returning it to the database .
43827	Reads up to < code > byte.length < /code > bytes of data from this input stream into an array of bytes . This method blocks until some input is available . < p > This method simply performs the call < code > read ( b , 0 , b.length ) < /code > and returns the result . It is important that it does < i > not < /i > do < code > in.read ( b ) < /code > instead ; certain subclasses of < code > FilterInputStream < /code > depend on the implementation strategy actually used .
43830	Called when a fragment is attached as a child of this fragment . < p > This is called after the attached fragment 's < code > onAttach < /code > and before the attached fragment 's < code > onCreate < /code > if the fragment has not yet had a previous call to < code > onCreate < /code > . < /p >
43833	Flushes this data output stream . This forces any buffered output bytes to be written out to the stream . < p > The < code > flush < /code > method of < code > DataOutputStream < /code > calls the < code > flush < /code > method of its underlying output stream .
43836	Called while a drag operation is ongoing , when the mouse pointer has exited the operable part of the drop site for the < code > DropTarget < /code > registered with this listener .
43840	Encodes an Object using the refined soundex algorithm . This method is provided in order to satisfy the requirements of the Encoder interface , and will throw an EncoderException if the supplied object is not of type java.lang.String .
43848	Launch a thread that will run an XMLReader 's parse ( ) operation within a thread , feeding events to this IncrementalSAXSource_Filter . Mostly a convenience routine , but has the advantage that -- since we invoked parse ( ) -- we can halt parsing quickly via a StopException rather than waiting for the SAX stream to end by itself .
43852	Configure the socket connection to be either pooled or closed when it is either exhausted or closed . If it is unneeded when this is called , it will be released immediately .
43857	Checks that this annotation node is compatible with the given ASM API version . This methods checks that this node , and all its nodes recursively , do not contain elements that were introduced in more recent versions of the ASM API than the given version .
43864	Switches to backup ( password ) screen . This either can happen when fingerprint is not available or the user chooses to use the password authentication method by pressing the button . This can also happen when the user had too many fingerprint attempts .
43866	Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it should start its execution . It is called after the < code > init < /code > method and each time the applet is revisited in a Web page . < p > A subclass of < code > Applet < /code > should override this method if it has any operation that it wants to perform each time the Web page containing it is visited . For example , an applet with animation might want to use the < code > start < /code > method to resume animation , and the < code > stop < /code > method to suspend the animation . < p > Note : some methods , such as < code > getLocationOnScreen < /code > , can only provide meaningful results if the applet is showing . Because < code > isShowing < /code > returns < code > false < /code > when the applet 's < code > start < /code > is first called , methods requiring < code > isShowing < /code > to return < code > true < /code > should be called from a < code > ComponentListener < /code > . < p > The implementation of this method provided by the < code > Applet < /code > class does nothing .
43876	Gets the total number of months in this period . < p > This returns the total number of months in the period by multiplying the number of years by 12 and adding the number of months . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .

43947	Indicates whether the use of the exec method will be allowed on this system . It will be allowed by default , but that capability will be removed if the org.opends.server.DisableExec system property is set and has any value other than `` false '' , `` off '' , `` no '' , or `` 0 '' .
43955	Returns the number of bytes currently being used to store the values in this cache . This may be greater than the max size if a background deletion is pending .
43959	Returns items , which overlap with p_shape on layer p_layer inclusive clearance . p_clearance_class is the index in the clearance matrix , which describes the required clearance restrictions to other items . The function may also return items , which are nearly overlapping , but do not overlap with exact calculation . If p_layer < 0 , the layer is ignored .
43980	Validate a JSP page . This will get invoked once per unique tag library URI in the XML view . This method will return null if the page is valid ; otherwise the method should return an array of ValidationMessage objects . An array of length zero is also interpreted as no errors .
43993	Method which gets invoked after a entry entry is deleted . The deletion type configured in Sun Java System Access Manager is also passed as a parameter to this method .
44001	Removes a policy listener that was previously registered to receive notifications whenever a policy is added , removed or changed . It is not an error to attempt to remove a listener that was not registered . It would return silently .
44002	Convenience method to create movement flags . < p > For instance , if you want to let your items be drag & dropped vertically and swiped left to be dismissed , you can call this method with : < code > makeMovementFlags ( UP | DOWN , LEFT ) ; < /code >
44008	Gives notification from the document that attributes were changed in a location that this view is responsible for . If the zone has been loaded , the superclass behavior is invoked , otherwise this does nothing .
44021	Report a fatal XML parsing error . < p > The default implementation throws a SAXParseException . Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they need to take specific actions for each fatal error ( such as collecting all of the errors into a single report ) : in any case , the application must stop all regular processing when this method is invoked , since the document is no longer reliable , and the parser may no longer report parsing events. < /p >
44029	Determines if the glyphs should be rendered as subscript . < p > When you request this property , < code > LabelView < /code > re-syncs its state with the properties of the < code > Element < /code > 's < code > AttributeSet < /code > . If < code > Element < /code > 's < code > AttributeSet < /code > does not have this property set , it will revert to false .
44032	Removes the nth selected item in the object from the object 's selection . If the nth item is n't currently selected , this method has no effect . Otherwise , it closes the popup menu .
44040	Removes the < code > Subject < /code > object identified by the subject name . If a subject instance with the given name does not exist , the method will return silently .
44054	This sets the user object of the TreeNode identified by path and posts a node changed . If you use custom user objects in the TreeModel you 're going to need to subclass this and set the user object of the changed node to something meaningful .
44062	Returns the 1-based position where an object is on this stack . If the object < tt > o < /tt > occurs as an item in this stack , this method returns the distance from the top of the stack of the occurrence nearest the top of the stack ; the topmost item on the stack is considered to be at distance < tt > 1 < /tt > . The < tt > equals < /tt > method is used to compare < tt > o < /tt > to the items in this stack .
44063	Test whether the given node is a namespace decl node . In DOM Level 2 this can be done in a namespace-aware manner , but in Level 1 DOMs it has to be done by testing the node name .

44070	Determines if the glyphs should be underlined . If true , an underline should be drawn through the baseline . This is implemented to return the cached underline property . < p > When you request this property , < code > LabelView < /code > re-syncs its state with the properties of the < code > Element < /code > 's < code > AttributeSet < /code > . If < code > Element < /code > 's < code > AttributeSet < /code > does not have this property set , it will revert to false .
44077	Calls < code > dragExit < /code > on the < code > DragSourceListener < /code > s registered with this < code > DragSourceContext < /code > and with the associated < code > DragSource < /code > , and passes them the specified < code > DragSourceEvent < /code > .
44082	may not work on KitKat due to lack of implementation of openFileChooser ( ) or onShowFileChooser ( ) https : //code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail ? id=62220 however newer versions of KitKat fixed it on some devices
44085	Removes the password changed time value from the user 's entry . This should only be used for testing purposes , as it can really mess things up if you do n't know what you 're doing .
44086	Returns an instance of the UI delegate for the specified component . Each subclass must provide its own static < code > createUI < /code > method that returns an instance of that UI delegate subclass . If the UI delegate subclass is stateless , it may return an instance that is shared by multiple components . If the UI delegate is stateful , then it should return a new instance per component . The default implementation of this method throws an error , as it should never be invoked .
44093	Enables the center tracker with a custom drawable resource . This tracker is always visible.\n Please note that you can still scan a barcode outside the center tracker ! This is purely a visual change .
44095	Writes the next attribute to the stream as a < code > String < /code > in the Java programming language . The driver converts this to a SQL < code > NCHAR < /code > or < code > NVARCHAR < /code > or < code > LONGNVARCHAR < /code > value ( depending on the argument 's size relative to the driver 's limits on < code > NVARCHAR < /code > values ) when it sends it to the stream .
44100	Changes current seed by supplementing a seed argument to the current seed , if this already set ; the argument is used as first seed otherwise . < BR > The method overrides `` engineSetSeed ( byte [ ] ) '' in class SecureRandomSpi .
44104	Method to be called after the all global expressions within a stylesheet have been collected . It eliminates redundent expressions by creating a variable in the psuedoVarRecipient for each redundent expression , and then rewriting the redundent expression to be a variable reference .
44105	Test whether the _last_ endDocument ( ) has been processed . This is needed as guidance for stylesheet optimization and compilation engines , which generally do n't want to start until all included and imported stylesheets have been fully parsed .
44111	Create an entity for this test . This is a static method , as tests for other entities might also need it , if they test an entity which requires the current entity .
44113	Test whether formatter will throw exception if object for key was not found . If given map does not contain object for key specified , it could throw an exception . Returns true if throws . If not , key is left unchanged .
44130	Indicates whether the restore process should only attempt to verify the validity and/or integrity of the backup files to the best of its ability rather than actually trying to restore . Note that in some cases , the ability to verify a backup files will not be able to guarantee that they may be used , but will it must at least verify that the appropriate file ( s ) exist , that any hashes or signatures are valid , and that any encryption can be decrypted .
44142	Adds the given printer state reason to this printer state reasons attribute , associating it with the given severity level . If this printer state reasons attribute previously contained a mapping for the given printer state reason , the old value is replaced .
44147	Removes a < code > PropertyChangeListener < /code > from the listener list . This removes a < code > PropertyChangeListener < /code > that was registered for all properties .
44148	Get the encoded representation of this namevalue object . Added doublequote for encoding doublequoted values . Bug : RFC3261 stipulates that an opaque parameter in authenticate header has to be : opaque = `` opaque '' EQUAL quoted-string so returning just the name is not acceptable . ( e.g . LinkSys phones are picky about this )
44164	Returns the given number of seed bytes , computed using the seed generation algorithm that this class uses to seed itself . This call may be used to seed other random number generators .
44176	Returns the character at position < tt > pos < /tt > from the matched text . It is equivalent to yytext ( ) .charAt ( pos ) , but faster
44177	Returns the result of sending < code > toString ( ) < /code > to this node 's user object , or the empty string if the node has no user object .
44187	See the general contract of the < code > readBoolean < /code > method of < code > DataInput < /code > . < p > Bytes for this operation are read from the contained input stream .
44188	This hook is called whenever an item in your options menu is selected . The default implementation simply returns false to have the normal processing happen ( calling the item 's Runnable or sending a message to its Handler as appropriate ) . You can use this method for any items for which you would like to do processing without those other facilities . < p > Derived classes should call through to the base class for it to perform the default menu handling .
44189	This is a method used to set to null the different members that provide information about the last refused certificate . It is recommended to call this method before trying to establish a connection using this trust manager .
44201	Returns a string representation of this drop location . This method is intended to be used for debugging purposes , and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations .
44205	Execute this SQL statement and return the ID of the row inserted due to this call . The SQL statement should be an INSERT for this to be a useful call .
44209	Consider the two direction vectors written as Xa Xb Ya Yb The determinant is zero if they are `` colinear '' or > 0 if on right or < 0 if on left There is some chance of overflow here , small one , in theory TODO I should check that dir_x `` dir_Y are never > 32 bits
44222	Returns true if < code > anotherNode < /code > is an ancestor of this node -- if it is this node , this node 's parent , or an ancestor of this node 's parent . ( Note that a node is considered an ancestor of itself . ) If < code > anotherNode < /code > is null , this method returns false . This operation is at worst O ( h ) where h is the distance from the root to this node .
44225	Determines whether a Component is an acceptable choice as the new focus owner . By default , this method will accept a Component if and only if it is visible , displayable , enabled , and focusable .
44246	Enables all the attribute change notifications the attribute name of which equals the specified name to be sent to the listener . < BR > If the specified name is already in the list of enabled attribute names , this method has no effect .

44300	Returns a string representation of this < code > JPasswordField < /code > . This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes , and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations . The returned string may be empty but may not be < code > null < /code > .
44309	Throws an < code > org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT < /code > exception with the message `` This is a locally constrained object . '' This method does not apply to local objects and is therefore not implemented . This method is the default implementation of the < code > org.omg.CORBA.Object < /code > method. < P >
44314	Returns a set no longer needed by the MutableAttributeSet implementation . This is useful for operation under 1.1 where there are no weak references . This would typically be called by the finalize method of the MutableAttributeSet implementation . < p > This method is thread safe , although most Swing methods are not . Please see < A HREF= '' https : //docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html '' > Concurrency in Swing < /A > for more information .
44331	Returns a Set view of the entries contained in this Cache . Each element in this collection is a Map.Entry . The Set is backed by the Cache , so changes to the Cache are reflected in the Set , and vice-versa . The Set supports element removal ( which removes the corresponding entry from the Cache ) , but not element addition .
44339	Make an integer into an HH hex value . Does no checking on the size of the input , since this is only meant to be used locally by writeAttrURI .
44351	Closes this < code > FileCacheImageOutputStream < /code > . All pending data is flushed to the output , and the cache file is closed and removed . The destination < code > OutputStream < /code > is not closed .
44360	Called by a zone when it gets loaded . This happens when an attempt is made to display or perform a model/view translation on a zone that was in an unloaded state . This is implemented to check if the maximum number of zones was reached and to unload the oldest zone if so .

44395	Returns a hash code for this byte string builder . It will be the sum of all of the bytes contained in the byte string builder . < p > < b > NOTE : < /b > subsequent changes to this byte string builder will invalidate the returned hash code .
44398	Returns < code > true < /code > if the primary type and the subtype of this object are the same as the content type described in < code > rawdata < /code > ; otherwise returns < code > false < /code > .
44399	Tells whether or not this URI is opaque . < p > A URI is opaque if , and only if , it is absolute and its scheme-specific part does not begin with a slash character ( '/ ' ) . An opaque URI has a scheme , a scheme-specific part , and possibly a fragment ; all other components are undefined . < /p >
44432	Close out the query result set if there are no more pending resources and the LDAP result has been received . This method must be invoked with the sequenceLock held .
44448	Terminates the current line by writing the line separator string . The line separator string is defined by the system property < code > line.separator < /code > , and is not necessarily a single newline character ( < code > '\n ' < /code > ) .
44464	Serializes an object and returns the Base64-encoded version of that serialized object . If the object can not be serialized or there is another error , the method will return < tt > null < /tt > . The object is not GZip-compressed before being encoded .
44482	Translate a point considering the angle ( in degrees ) and the offset ( x , y ) . Move the pointer on the tangent defined by the angle by the x value and move the pointer on the perpendicular defined by the angle by the y value .
44489	Paints the component 's border . < p > If you override this in a subclass you should not make permanent changes to the passed in < code > Graphics < /code > . For example , you should not alter the clip < code > Rectangle < /code > or modify the transform . If you need to do these operations you may find it easier to create a new < code > Graphics < /code > from the passed in < code > Graphics < /code > and manipulate it .
44512	Receive notification of the beginning of the document . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the beginning of a document ( such as allocating the root node of a tree or creating an output file ) . < /p >
44516	It is very important that sub-classes implement this if they contain any references to the activity ( anything in the view hierarchy etc. ) . If not , leaks can result since ItemInfo objects persist across rotation and can hence leak by holding stale references to the old view hierarchy / activity .
44518	Copies the specified array , truncating or padding with zeros ( if necessary ) so the copy has the specified length . For all indices that are valid in both the original array and the copy , the two arrays will contain identical values . For any indices that are valid in the copy but not the original , the copy will contain < tt > 0 < /tt > . Such indices will exist if and only if the specified length is greater than that of the original array .
44522	Makes a copy of this reference using its class name list of addresses , class factory name and class factory location . Changes to the newly created copy does not affect this Reference and vice versa .
44524	generate a signed object that for a CMS Signed Data object using the given provider - if encapsulate is true a copy of the message will be included in the signature with the default content type `` data '' .
44548	Invoked when a property changes on the root pane . If the event indicates the < code > defaultButton < /code > has changed , this will reinstall the keyboard actions .
44549	Registers the provided OID as a supported feature for the Directory Server . This will have no effect if the specified feature OID is already present in the list of supported features .
44556	Returns the < code > index < /code > th item in the map . If < code > index < /code > is greater than or equal to the number of nodes in this map , this returns < code > null < /code > .
44565	Convert from a Java Calendar instance into a Unix Time stamp . Java Calendar instances contain timezone information . This will be lost in the conversion and no attempt will be made to reconcile the local timezone with the timezone information in the Calendar .
44570	Writes a message to the access logger with information about the extended request associated with the provided extended operation . < p > The default implementation is to not log anything .
44572	Returns the hash code for this set . Two set which are equal must return the same value . This implementation calculates the hash code by adding each element 's hash code .
44583	Returns true if the request line should contain the full URL with host and port ( like `` GET http : //android.com/foo HTTP/1.1 '' ) or only the path ( like `` GET /foo HTTP/1.1 '' ) .
44599	Returns the stub for the remote object < code > obj < /code > passed as a parameter . This operation is only valid < i > after < /i > the object has been exported .
44601	Returns the query of this URL , encoded for use in HTTP resource resolution . The returned string may be null ( for URLs with no query ) , empty ( for URLs with an empty query ) or non-empty ( all other URLs ) .
44610	Returns whether this vector is in an axis-aligned bounding box . < p > The minimum and maximum vectors given must be truly the minimum and maximum X , Y and Z components .
44621	Test if the last received updates was acknowledged ( ack sent with or without errors ) . < p > WARNING : this must be called once per update as it also immediately resets the status for a new test for the next update < /p >
44627	Checks whether a socket connection is secure . This factory creates TLS/SSL socket connections which , by default , are considered secure . < br/ > Derived classes may override this method to perform runtime checks , for example based on the cypher suite .
44634	Copies the specified array , truncating or padding with zeros ( if necessary ) so the copy has the specified length . For all indices that are valid in both the original array and the copy , the two arrays will contain identical values . For any indices that are valid in the copy but not the original , the copy will contain < tt > ( short ) 0 < /tt > . Such indices will exist if and only if the specified length is greater than that of the original array .
44637	Sets the field wordsInUse to the logical size in words of the bit set . WARNING : This method assumes that the number of words actually in use is less than or equal to the current value of wordsInUse !
44638	called from superclass child removal operations after a child has been successfully removed . called with child synchronized . This subclass uses this hook to immediately revoke any services being used by this child if it is a BeanContextChild . subclasses may envelope this method in order to implement their own child removal side-effects .
44652	Returns true if the specified character is valid . This method also checks the surrogate character range from 0x10000 to 0x10FFFF . < p > If the program chooses to apply the mask directly to the < code > CHARS < /code > array , then they are responsible for checking the surrogate character range .
44658	Makes a field flag by bit position . Bit positions are numbered 1 to 32 . But position 0 corresponds to flag 1 , position 3 corresponds to flag 4 etc .
44659	Called by the UI when the user chooses the Cancel button . This can also be called by the programmer . This method causes an action event to fire with the command string equal to < code > CANCEL_SELECTION < /code > .
44663	called by writeObject after defaultWriteObject ( ) but prior to serialization of currently serializable children . This method may be overridden by subclasses to perform custom serialization of their state prior to this superclass serializing the children . This method should not however be used by subclasses to replace their own implementation ( if any ) of writeObject ( ) .
44671	Removes the children list if this node has no children anymore ; checks if the provided node is a schema node and does n't have any children anymore , its deleted .
44674	Tests whether a file is readable . This method checks that a file exists and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges that would allow it open the file for reading . Depending on the implementation , this method may require to read file permissions , access control lists , or other file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file . Consequently , this method may not be atomic with respect to other file system operations . < p > Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated , there is no guarantee that a subsequent attempt to open the file for reading will succeed ( or even that it will access the same file ) . Care should be taken when using this method in security sensitive applications .
44678	Add an attribute to an attribute list . < p > This method is provided for SAX parser writers , to allow them to build up an attribute list incrementally before delivering it to the application. < /p >
44688	Appends text to the logs ( Details are ) section of the panel . The text will be appended as it is ( is similar to print ( ) ) .
44714	Creates and returns an enumeration that follows the path from < code > ancestor < /code > to this node . The enumeration 's < code > nextElement ( ) < /code > method first returns < code > ancestor < /code > , then the child of < code > ancestor < /code > that is an ancestor of this node , and so on , and finally returns this node . Creation of the enumeration is O ( m ) where m is the number of nodes between this node and < code > ancestor < /code > , inclusive . Each < code > nextElement ( ) < /code > message is O ( 1 ) . < P > Modifying the tree by inserting , removing , or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification .
44715	Creates a TopologyMsg filled with information to be sent to a remote RS . We send remote RS the info of every DS that are directly connected to us plus our own info as RS .
44732	Removes the designated object from this < code > RowSet < /code > object 's list of listeners . If the given argument is not a registered listener , this method does nothing . < b > Note < /b > : if the < code > RowSetListener < /code > object is < code > null < /code > , this method silently discards the < code > null < /code > value .
44742	Returns true if the current thread is an AWT event dispatching thread . < p > As of 1.3 this method is just a cover for < code > java.awt.EventQueue.isDispatchThread ( ) < /code > .
44753	Checks if the account is locked out and needs to be unlocked . this is for memory locking . If duration has passed then the user is removed from the < code > loginFailHash < /code > Map .
44754	Indicates whether the provided object is equal to this modification . It will only be considered equal if the object is a modification with the same modification type and an attribute that is equal to this modification .
44756	Schedules the specified task for repeated < i > fixed-rate execution < /i > , beginning at the specified time . Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals , separated by the specified period . < p > In fixed-rate execution , each execution is scheduled relative to the scheduled execution time of the initial execution . If an execution is delayed for any reason ( such as garbage collection or other background activity ) , two or more executions will occur in rapid succession to `` catch up . '' In the long run , the frequency of execution will be exactly the reciprocal of the specified period ( assuming the system clock underlying < tt > Object.wait ( long ) < /tt > is accurate ) . As a consequence of the above , if the scheduled first time is in the past , then any `` missed '' executions will be scheduled for immediate `` catch up '' execution . < p > Fixed-rate execution is appropriate for recurring activities that are sensitive to < i > absolute < /i > time , such as ringing a chime every hour on the hour , or running scheduled maintenance every day at a particular time . It is also appropriate for recurring activities where the total time to perform a fixed number of executions is important , such as a countdown timer that ticks once every second for ten seconds . Finally , fixed-rate execution is appropriate for scheduling multiple repeating timer tasks that must remain synchronized with respect to one another .
44773	Closes the underlying < code > Reader < /code > quietly . This method is useful if you only want to process the first few lines of a larger file . If you do not close the iterator then the < code > Reader < /code > remains open . This method can safely be called multiple times .
44780	Returns true if computeFreshnessLifetime used a heuristic . If we used a heuristic to serve a cached response older than 24 hours , we are required to attach a warning .
44781	Based on pattern of odd-even ( ' L ' and ' G ' ) patterns used to encoded the explicitly-encoded digits in a barcode , determines the implicitly encoded first digit and adds it to the result string .
44786	Returns true if we are currently inside of an undo/redo operation . This is useful for editors to know whether they should be generating new undo state when they see edit operations happening .
44790	Returns the character at the specified index . An index ranges from < code > 0 < /code > to < code > length ( ) - 1 < /code > . The first character of the sequence is at index < code > 0 < /code > , the next at index < code > 1 < /code > , and so on , as for array indexing .
44794	Low-level access to decoding ASCII characters in the form of a byte array . < strong > Ignores GUNZIP option , if it 's set. < /strong > This is not generally a recommended method , although it is used internally as part of the decoding process . Special case : if len = 0 , an empty array is returned . Still , if you need more speed and reduced memory footprint ( and are n't gzipping ) , consider this method .
44805	Writes a string to the underlying output stream using < a href= '' DataInput.html # modified-utf-8 '' > modified UTF-8 < /a > encoding in a machine-independent manner . < p > First , two bytes are written to the output stream as if by the < code > writeShort < /code > method giving the number of bytes to follow . This value is the number of bytes actually written out , not the length of the string . Following the length , each character of the string is output , in sequence , using the modified UTF-8 encoding for the character . If no exception is thrown , the counter < code > written < /code > is incremented by the total number of bytes written to the output stream . This will be at least two plus the length of < code > str < /code > , and at most two plus thrice the length of < code > str < /code > .
44806	Decrements the count of in-flight transactions to the resource being monitored . < p/ > If this operation results in the counter falling below 0 - an exception is raised .
44811	Returns whether the specified < var > ch < /var > conforms to the XML 1.0 definition of whitespace . Refer to < A href= '' http : //www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210 # NT-S '' > the definition of < CODE > S < /CODE > < /A > for details .
44824	Starts the login process for the given < code > AuthContext < /code > object identified by the index type and index name with default parameters . The < code > IndexType < /code > defines the possible kinds of `` objects '' or `` resources '' for which an authentication can be performed . Currently supported index types are users , roles , services ( or application ) , levels , resources and mechanism/authentication modules .
44839	Copies the specified array , truncating or padding with zeros ( if necessary ) so the copy has the specified length . For all indices that are valid in both the original array and the copy , the two arrays will contain identical values . For any indices that are valid in the copy but not the original , the copy will contain < tt > 0f < /tt > . Such indices will exist if and only if the specified length is greater than that of the original array .
44848	Convert a String value to 'boolean ' . Besides the standard conversions done by Boolean.parseBoolean ( s ) , the value `` yes '' ( ignore case ) is also converted to 'true ' . If 's ' is null , then 'false ' is returned .
44851	Paint a representation of the value into a given area of screen real estate . Note that the propertyEditor is responsible for doing its own clipping so that it fits into the given rectangle . < p > If the PropertyEditor does n't honor paint requests ( see isPaintable ) this method should be a silent noop .
44863	< p > Returns a shallow clone of this instance . The clone is obtained by simply calling < tt > super.clone ( ) < /tt > , thus calling the default native shallow cloning mechanism implemented by < tt > Object.clone ( ) < /tt > . No deeper cloning of any internal field is made. < /p > < p > Since this class is immutable , cloning is chiefly of interest to subclasses. < /p >
44868	Returns a copy of this OffsetDateTime with the specified number of weeks added . < p > This method adds the specified amount in weeks to the days field incrementing the month and year fields as necessary to ensure the result remains valid . The result is only invalid if the maximum/minimum year is exceeded . < p > For example , 2008-12-31 plus one week would result in 2009-01-07 . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .
44885	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
44899	Sets the current position to index . The current position is indexed 0 to n-1 , that is , index zero corresponds to the first component . The operation returns true if the resulting current position indicates a component of the DynAny and false if index indicates a position that does not correspond to a component . Calling seek with a negative index is legal . It sets the current position to -1 to indicate no component and returns false . Passing a non-negative index value for a DynAny that does not have a component at the corresponding position sets the current position to -1 and returns false .
44901	Searches for an object in the array . If it is found its index will be returned . This method only returns the index of an object that is < b > identical < /b > to the given one . Thus objects that might contain the same value as the given one will not be considered .
44917	Adds the specified component to this container at the given position . If < code > index < /code > equals -1 , the component will be appended to the end .
44921	Receive notification of a warning . < p > SAX parsers will use this method to report conditions that are not errors or fatal errors as defined by the XML 1.0 recommendation . The default behaviour is to take no action. < /p > < p > The SAX parser must continue to provide normal parsing events after invoking this method : it should still be possible for the application to process the document through to the end. < /p >
44932	Conditionally trim all leading and trailing whitespace in the specified String . All strings of white space are replaced by a single space character ( # x20 ) , except spaces after punctuation which receive double spaces if doublePunctuationSpaces is true . This function may be useful to a formatter , but to get first class results , the formatter should probably do it 's own white space handling based on the semantics of the formatting object .
44947	Log a FINEST message . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the FINEST message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
44970	Removes the first occurrence of an item from the list . If the specified item is selected , and is the only selected item in the list , the list is set to have no selection .
44978	Returns the index for value , assuming value is valid for this < tt > TabularData < /tt > instance ( ie value is not null , and its composite type is equal to row type ) . The index is a List , and not an array , so that an index.equals ( otherIndex ) call will actually compare contents , not just the objects references as is done for an array object . The returned List is unmodifiable so that once a row has been put into the dataMap , its index can not be modified , for example by a user that would attempt to modify an index contained in the Set returned by keySet ( ) .
44987	Compares the specified Object with this < code > OblixPrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns < code > true < /code > if the given object is also a < code > OblixPrincipal < /code > and the two < code > OblixPrincipal < /code > s have the same user name .
44990	Returns whether or not the supplied key event maps to a key that is used for navigation . This is used for optimizing key input by only passing non- navigation keys to the first letter navigation mechanism .
44991	Transfers the currently selected range in the associated text model to the system clipboard , removing the contents from the model . The current selection is reset . Does nothing for < code > null < /code > selections .
44999	Update the scene camera based on the provided pose in Tango start of service frame . The device pose should match the pose of the device at the time the last rendered RGB frame , which can be retrieved with this.getTimestamp ( ) ; NOTE : This must be called from the OpenGL render thread - it is not thread safe .
45004	Each of these parsing methods is responsible for recognizing an RDF syntax production and adding the appropriate structure to the XMP tree . They simply return for success , failures will throw an exception .
45014	Deletes a component from this composite name . The component of this composite name at position 'posn ' is removed , and components at indices greater than 'posn ' are shifted down ( towards index 0 ) by one .
45015	Atomically updates the current value with the results of applying the given function , returning the updated value . The function should be side-effect-free , since it may be re-applied when attempted updates fail due to contention among threads .
45023	Creates a new font program . This font program can be one of the 14 built in fonts , a Type1 font referred to by an AFM or PFM file , a TrueType font ( simple or one from collection ) or a CJK font from the Adobe Asian Font Pack . TrueType fonts and CJK fonts can have an optional style modifier appended to the name . These modifiers are : Bold , Italic and BoldItalic . An example would be `` STSong-Light , Bold '' . Note that this modifiers do not work if the font is embedded . Fonts in TrueType Collections are addressed by index such as `` msgothic.ttc,1 '' . This would get the second font ( indexes start at 0 ) , in this case `` MS PGothic '' . < p/ > The fonts are cached and if they already exist they are extracted from the cache , not parsed again . < p/ >
45050	This is the normal call when xsl : fallback is instantiated . In accordance with the XSLT 1.0 Recommendation , chapter 15 , `` Normally , instantiating an xsl : fallback element does nothing . ''
45070	Receive notification of a parser warning . < p > The default implementation does nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each warning , such as inserting the message in a log file or printing it to the console. < /p >
45071	Bind an object to this session , using the specified name . If an object of the same name is already bound to this session , the object is replaced . < p > After this method executes , and if the object implements < code > HttpSessionBindingListener < /code > , the container calls < code > valueBound ( ) < /code > on the object .
45075	Returns a pool that adaptively decreases its size when idle objects are no longer needed . This is intended as an always thread-safe alternative to using an idle object evictor provided by many pool implementations . This is also an effective way to shrink FIFO ordered pools that experience load spikes . < p > The factor parameter provides a mechanism to tweak the rate at which the pool tries to shrink its size . Values between 0 and 1 cause the pool to try to shrink its size more often . Values greater than 1 cause the pool to less frequently try to shrink its size . < /p >
45077	Add a log Handler to receive logging messages . < p > By default , Loggers also send their output to their parent logger . Typically the root Logger is configured with a set of Handlers that essentially act as default handlers for all loggers .
45078	This method is required to avoid compilation warnings . It basically adds the contents of a collection to another collection by explicitly casting its values . This is done because the method getModification ( ) returns au undefined type .
45080	Migrate a DTM built with an old DTMManager to a new DTMManager . After the migration , the new DTMManager will treat the DTM as one that is built by itself . This is used to support DTM sharing between multiple transformations .
45089	This hook is called whenever an item in your options menu is selected . The default implementation simply returns false to have the normal processing happen ( calling the item 's Runnable or sending a message to its Handler as appropriate ) . You can use this method for any items for which you would like to do processing without those other facilities . < p > Derived classes should call through to the base class for it to perform the default menu handling .
45102	Update the ring color if this is within the last 25 % of the animation . The new ring color will be a translation from the starting ring color to the next color .
45112	Compares the specified Object with this < code > DataStorePrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns < code > true < /code > if the given object is also a < code > DataStorePrincipal < /code > and the two DataStorePrincipals have the same user name .
45128	Select an appropriate character encoding to be used , based on the characteristics of the current request and/or filter initialization parameters . If no character encoding should be set , return < code > null < /code > . < p > The default implementation unconditionally returns the value configured by the < strong > encoding < /strong > initialization parameter for this filter .
45129	Tests if this input stream supports the < code > mark < /code > and < code > reset < /code > methods . The < code > markSupported < /code > method of < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > returns < code > true < /code > .
45142	Retrieves the named object , following links except for the terminal atomic component of the name . If the object bound to name is not a link , returns the object itself .
45158	< p > Returns a descriptor which is equal to this descriptor . Changes to the returned descriptor will have no effect on this descriptor , and vice versa. < /p > < p > This method returns the object on which it is called . A subclass can override it to return another object provided the contract is respected .
45160	Tells whether a given access modifier is synchronized . A modifier is synchronized if it is marked with the ACC_SYNCHRONIZED flag ( 0x0020 ) , as specified in JLS8 , 4.6 < tt > Methods < /tt > and JLS8 , 2.11.10 < tt > Synchronization < /tt >
45168	Checks two MBeanPermission objects for equality . Checks that < i > obj < /i > is an MBeanPermission , and has the same name and actions as this object . < P >
45170	Submits the populated < code > Callback < /code > objects to the authentication plug-in modules . Called after < code > getInformationRequired < /code > method and obtaining user 's response to these requests .
45196	Returns a String that contains the html passed as parameter with a span applied . The span style corresponds to the Font specified as parameter . The goal of this method is to be able to specify a font for an HTML string .
45208	Checks if the specified year is a leap year . < p > Thai Buddhist leap years occur exactly in line with ISO leap years . This method does not validate the year passed in , and only has a well-defined result for years in the supported range .
45213	This controls the action to take with the item the player is holding . This includes both blocks and items ( such as flint and steel or records ) . When this is set to default , it will be allowed if no action is taken on the interacted block .
45219	The `` s-maxage '' directive is the max age for shared caches . Not to be confused with `` max-age '' for non-shared caches , As in Firefox and Chrome , this directive is not honored by this cache .
45226	Produces a method handle giving read access to a non-static field . The type of the method handle will have a return type of the field 's value type . The method handle 's single argument will be the instance containing the field . Access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class .
45231	Indicates whether or not the caret is currently visible . As the caret flashes on and off the return value of this will change between true , when the caret is painted , and false , when the caret is not painted . < code > isActive < /code > indicates whether or not the caret is in a blinking state , such that it < b > can < /b > be visible , and < code > isVisible < /code > indicates whether or not the caret < b > is < /b > actually visible . < p > Subclasses that wish to render a different flashing caret should override paint and only paint the caret if this method returns true .
45233	Returns a copy of this duration with the specified duration in standard 24 hour days added . < p > The number of days is multiplied by 86400 to obtain the number of seconds to add . This is based on the standard definition of a day as 24 hours . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .
45244	Perform layout for the minor axis of the box ( i.e . the axis orthogonal to the axis that it represents ) . The results of the layout should be placed in the given arrays which represent the allocations to the children along the minor axis . < p > This is implemented to do a baseline layout of the children by calling BoxView.baselineLayout .
45253	< p > Authenticate the user making this request , based on the fact that no < code > login-config < /code > has been defined for the container. < /p > < p > This implementation means `` login the user even though there is no self-contained way to establish a security Principal for that user '' . < /p > < p > This method is called by the AuthenticatorBase super class to establish a Principal for the user BEFORE the container security constraints are examined , i.e . it is not yet known whether the user will eventually be permitted to access the requested resource . Therefore , it is necessary to always return < code > true < /code > to indicate the user has not failed authentication. < /p > < p > There are two cases : < /p > < ul > < li > without SingleSignon : a Session instance does not yet exist and there is no < code > auth-method < /code > to authenticate the user , so leave Request 's Principal as null . Note : AuthenticatorBase will later examine the security constraints to determine whether the resource is accessible by a user without a security Principal and Role ( i.e . unauthenticated ) . < /li > < li > with SingleSignon : if the user has already authenticated via another container ( using its own login configuration ) , then associate this Session with the SSOEntry so it inherits the already-established security Principal and associated Roles . Note : This particular session will become a full member of the SingleSignOnEntry Session collection and so will potentially keep the SSOE `` alive '' , even if all the other properly authenticated Sessions expire first ... until it expires too . < /li > < /ul >
45268	Iterates over each entry contained in the map and writes out the entry in LDIF format . The main benefit of this method is that the entries can be sorted by DN and output in sorted order .
45272	Swaps the type code from the originating octets to the Unknown type so that the super class can find the corresponding type and toString ( ) in that class can generate output that looks like `` UNKNOWN TYPE : `` followed by the hexadecimal representation of the original unchanged set of octets .
45273	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence ( from first to last element ) . < p > The returned array will be `` safe '' in that no references to it are maintained by this list . ( In other words , this method must allocate a new array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array . < p > This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs .
45275	Adds an AdjustmentListener . Adjustment listeners are notified each time the scrollbar 's model changes . Adjustment events are provided for backwards compatibility with java.awt.Scrollbar . < p > Note that the AdjustmentEvents type property will always have a placeholder value of AdjustmentEvent.TRACK because all changes to a BoundedRangeModels value are considered equivalent . To change the value of a BoundedRangeModel one just sets its value property , i.e . model.setValue ( 123 ) . No information about the origin of the change , e.g . it 's a block decrement , is provided . We do n't try fabricate the origin of the change here .
45277	Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it should stop its execution . It is called when the Web page that contains this applet has been replaced by another page , and also just before the applet is to be destroyed . < p > A subclass of < code > Applet < /code > should override this method if it has any operation that it wants to perform each time the Web page containing it is no longer visible . For example , an applet with animation might want to use the < code > start < /code > method to resume animation , and the < code > stop < /code > method to suspend the animation . < p > The implementation of this method provided by the < code > Applet < /code > class does nothing .
45278	Returns whether this document name attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class DocumentName . < LI > This document name attribute 's underlying string and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's underlying string are equal . < LI > This document name attribute 's locale and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's locale are equal . < /OL >
45279	Ensures that e.g . if a wildcard match was made on the half of a URL , the overall result reflects this rather than the match-type of the latter half of the URL only .
45290	Removes path from the selection . If path is in the selection The TreeSelectionListeners are notified . This has no effect if < code > path < /code > is null .
45292	Return true if the line is not left-to-right or right-to-left . This means it either has mixed runs of left-to-right and right-to-left text , or the base direction differs from the direction of the only run of text .
45301	Installs rollover borders on all the child components of the JComponent . < p > This is a convenience method to call < code > setBorderToRollover < /code > for each child component .
45312	< p > Returns a shallow clone of this instance . The clone is obtained by simply calling < tt > super.clone ( ) < /tt > , thus calling the default native shallow cloning mechanism implemented by < tt > Object.clone ( ) < /tt > . No deeper cloning of any internal field is made. < /p > < p > Since this class is immutable , cloning is chiefly of interest to subclasses. < /p >
45318	See < code > readObject < /code > and < code > writeObject < /code > in < code > JComponent < /code > for more information about serialization in Swing .

45360	Get the distance between this vector and another . The value of this method is not cached and uses a costly square-root function , so do not repeatedly call this method to get the vector 's magnitude . NaN will be returned if the inner result of the sqrt ( ) function overflows , which will be caused if the distance is too long .
45367	Simple utility method that searches the given array of Strings for the given string . This method is only called from getExtendedState if the developer has specified a specific state for the component to be in ( ie , has `` wedged '' the component in that state ) by specifying they client property `` Nimbus.State '' .
45369	Returns true if this component tiles its children -- that is , if it can guarantee that the children will not overlap . The repainting system is substantially more efficient in this common case . < code > JComponent < /code > subclasses that ca n't make this guarantee , such as < code > JLayeredPane < /code > , should override this method to return false .
45373	Specifies one or more LDAP object classes which is to be associated with any intermediate `` glue '' entries forming the DN template . Multiple object classes may be specified .
45389	Called by the renderers to convert the specified value to text . This implementation returns < code > value.toString < /code > , ignoring all other arguments . To control the conversion , subclass this method and use any of the arguments you need .

45452	Creates and returns an enumeration that follows the path from < code > ancestor < /code > to this node . The enumeration 's < code > nextElement ( ) < /code > method first returns < code > ancestor < /code > , then the child of < code > ancestor < /code > that is an ancestor of this node , and so on , and finally returns this node . Creation of the enumeration is O ( m ) where m is the number of nodes between this node and < code > ancestor < /code > , inclusive . Each < code > nextElement ( ) < /code > message is O ( 1 ) . < P > Modifying the tree by inserting , removing , or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification .
45458	Returns true if the specified character is valid . This method also checks the surrogate character range from 0x10000 to 0x10FFFF . < p > If the program chooses to apply the mask directly to the < code > XML11CHARS < /code > array , then they are responsible for checking the surrogate character range .

45487	Sends a request and optionally reads a response . Returns true if the request was successfully executed , and false if the request can be retried . Throws an exception if the request failed permanently .
45499	Returns a new Token object , by default . However , if you want , you can create and return subclass objects based on the value of ofKind . Simply add the cases to the switch for all those special cases . For example , if you have a subclass of Token called IDToken that you want to create if ofKind is ID , simply add something like : case MyParserConstants.ID : return new IDToken ( ofKind , image ) ; to the following switch statement . Then you can cast matchedToken variable to the appropriate type and use sit in your lexical actions .

45537	Writes statement < code > oldStm < /code > to the stream . The < code > oldStm < /code > should be written entirely in terms of the callers environment , i.e . the target and all arguments should be part of the object graph being written . These expressions represent a series of `` what happened '' expressions which tell the output stream how to produce an object graph like the original . < p > The implementation of this method will produce a second expression to represent the same expression in an environment that will exist when the stream is read . This is achieved simply by calling < code > writeObject < /code > on the target and all the arguments and building a new expression with the results .
45538	Restarts the directory server . < p > This will perform an in-core restart in which the existing server instance will be shut down , a new instance will be created , and it will be reinitialized and restarted .
45539	Remove the object bound with the specified name from this session .

45673	Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this queue . Attempts to addAll of a queue to itself result in < tt > IllegalArgumentException < /tt > . Further , the behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress . < p > This implementation iterates over the specified collection , and adds each element returned by the iterator to this queue , in turn . A runtime exception encountered while trying to add an element ( including , in particular , a < tt > null < /tt > element ) may result in only some of the elements having been successfully added when the associated exception is thrown .
45681	Writes a < code > Struct < /code > object in the Java programming language to this < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > object . The driver converts this value to an SQL structured type before returning it to the database . < P > This method should be used when an SQL structured type has been mapped to a < code > Struct < /code > object in the Java programming language ( the standard mapping ) . The method < code > writeObject < /code > should be used if an SQL structured type has been custom mapped to a class in the Java programming language .

46306	If there is a security manager , makes sure caller has permission to shut down threads in general ( see shutdownPerm ) . If this passes , additionally makes sure the caller is allowed to interrupt each worker thread . This might not be true even if first check passed , if the SecurityManager treats some threads specially .
46310	Creates a new DynAny object whose value is a deep copy of the DynAny on which it is invoked . The operation is polymorphic , that is , invoking it on one of the types derived from DynAny , such as DynStruct , creates the derived type but returns its reference as the DynAny base type .
46331	Deletes the component at the specified index . Each component in this vector with an index greater or equal to the specified index is shifted downward to have an index one smaller than the value it had previously .
46333	Invoked before sending the specified notification to the listener . < BR > This filter compares the type of the specified notification with each enabled type .

46358	Lays out the children . If the layout span has changed , the rows are rebuilt . The superclass functionality is called after checking and possibly rebuilding the rows . If the height has changed , the < code > preferenceChanged < /code > method is called on the parent since the vertical preference is rigid .
46359	First check is to see if the attribute type is operational . If so then a match is true if the allOpAttributes boolean is true or if the attribute type is found in the operational attributes HashSet . Both results can be negated if the expression operator is NOT_EQUALITY ) . Second check is similar to above , except the user attributes boolean and HashSet is examined .

46382	Adds the specified component to this card layout 's internal table of names . The object specified by < code > constraints < /code > must be a string . The card layout stores this string as a key-value pair that can be used for random access to a particular card . By calling the < code > show < /code > method , an application can display the component with the specified name .
46384	Sets the anchoring of region bounds for this matcher . < p > Invoking this method with an argument of < tt > true < /tt > will set this matcher to use < i > anchoring < /i > bounds . If the boolean argument is < tt > false < /tt > , then < i > non-anchoring < /i > bounds will be used . < p > Using anchoring bounds , the boundaries of this matcher 's region match anchors such as ^ and $ . < p > Without anchoring bounds , the boundaries of this matcher 's region will not match anchors such as ^ and $ . < p > By default , a matcher uses anchoring region boundaries .
46387	Compares this transition to another based on the transition instant . < p > This compares the instants of each transition . The offsets are ignored , making this order inconsistent with equals .
46389	Indicates whether split was forced by new line symbol in rendered text . The value will be set as true if , for example , the rendered text of one of the child renderers contains '\n ' symbol .
46391	Receive a message . This method is not thread-safe and should either always be called in a single thread or protected by a locking mechanism before being called . This is a wrapper to the method with a boolean version so that we do not have to modify existing tests .
46397	This method is called by the OpenAMSessionTokenServerInterceptor and OpenAMSessionTokenClientInterceptor classes when determining whether to assert the TransportToken . The AbstractTokenInterceptor # assertTokens is called in all four JASPI phases . The isTLSInUse implemented in the AbstractTokenInterceptor does not work in the secure-request or validate-response phases - it seems to work exclusively in the validate-request case . The OpenAMSessionToken interceptors need to assert the TransportToken in all four cases to prevent FINE warning messages concerning an unasserted TransportToken , hence this override , which works in all cases . This override will also consult the superclass method . Note however , that there is no state in the outgoing message corresponding to `` http.scheme '' in the server egress message , so the validate-response is not able to assert the TransportToken , and thus the FINE message warning of an unasserted TransportToken will appear . This is really the domain of the TransportBindingHandler ( see http : //cxf.547215.n5.nabble.com/Custom-SecurityPolicy-Assertions-and-the-Symmetric-binding-td5754879.html for details ) , so we will have to live with this error message .
46398	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object . It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy ( ) to avoid resource leaks . Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid . Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST . It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained .
46400	Given a set of encoded rules in startDay and startDayOfMonth , decode them and set the startMode appropriately . Do the same for endDay and endDayOfMonth . Upon entry , the day of week variables may be zero or negative , in order to indicate special modes . The day of month variables may also be negative . Upon exit , the mode variables will be set , and the day of week and day of month variables will be positive . This method also recognizes a startDay or endDay of zero as indicating no DST .
46403	Prints this exception 's stack trace to < tt > System.err < /tt > . If this exception has a root exception ; the stack trace of the root exception is printed to < tt > System.err < /tt > instead .
46424	Creates a new place-holder attribute type having the specified name , default syntax , and default matching rule . The OID of the place-holder attribute will be the normalized attribute type name followed by the suffix `` -oid '' .

46435	Determines whether each attribute in the attribute set is valid . This method additionally takes the organization name and SSOToken that would be passed to the validation . Iterates though the set checking each element to see if there is a validator that needs to execute .
46436	Replaces this UnmodifiableRandomAccessList with an UnmodifiableList so that JREs before 1.4 can deserialize this object without any problems . This is necessary since RandomAccess API was introduced only in 1.4 . < p >
46447	Change the selection with the effect of first clearing the values in the inclusive range [ clearMin , clearMax ] then setting the values in the inclusive range [ setMin , setMax ] . Do this in one pass so that no values are cleared if they would later be set .
46467	Sets up a number of internal server data structures to ensure that they are properly initialized for use . This is necessary if server libraries are going to be used without the server running ( e.g. , to facilitate use in an LDAP client API , for DN processing , etc. ) . This will have no effect if the server has already been initialized for client use .
46470	Search that the replicationServer has stopped sending changes after having reach the limit of the window size . And that the number of waiting changes is accurate . Do this by checking the monitoring information .
46474	Returns a string representation of this < code > JRootPane < /code > .

46505	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque in proper sequence ( from first to last element ) . < p > The returned array will be `` safe '' in that no references to it are maintained by this deque . ( In other words , this method must allocate a new array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array . < p > This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs .
46519	Copy bytes from an < code > InputStream < /code > to an < code > OutputStream < /code > . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > . < p > Large streams ( over 2GB ) will return a bytes copied value of < code > -1 < /code > after the copy has completed since the correct number of bytes can not be returned as an int . For large streams use the < code > copyLarge ( InputStream , OutputStream ) < /code > method .
46520	Supports reporting bound property changes . This method can be called when a bound property has changed and it will send the appropriate < code > PropertyChangeEvent < /code > to any registered < code > PropertyChangeListeners < /code > .
46526	Closes the underlying connection , and close any Statements that were not explicitly closed . Sub-classes that override this method must : < ol > < li > Call passivate ( ) < /li > < li > Call close ( or the equivalent appropriate action ) on the wrapped connection < /li > < li > Set _closed to < code > false < /code > < /li > < /ol >
46527	Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list . < p > Throws an < code > ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException < /code > if the index is out of range ( < code > index & lt ; 0 || index & gt ; size ( ) < /code > ) .
46532	Writes a message to the access logger with information about the modify response associated with the provided modify operation . < p > The default implementation is to not log anything .
46534	Removes the specified component from the container . If < code > comp < /code > is not the < code > rootPane < /code > , this will forward the call to the < code > contentPane < /code > . This will do nothing if < code > comp < /code > is not a child of the < code > JWindow < /code > or < code > contentPane < /code > .
46535	Receive notification of a notation declaration . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they wish to keep track of the notations declared in a document. < /p >
46558	Tells whether or not this reference object has been enqueued , either by the program or by the garbage collector . If this reference object was not registered with a queue when it was created , then this method will always return < code > false < /code > .
46560	Disables all the attribute change notifications the attribute name of which equals the specified attribute name to be sent to the listener . < BR > If the specified name is not in the list of enabled attribute names , this method has no effect .
46566	Check whether the given name is to be used according to the includes and excludes given . < ul > < li > If `` includes '' are set , check whether name is in this list and return true if so < /li > < li > If `` excludes '' are set , check whether name is in this list and return false if so < /li > < li > If neither of this is true , check whether `` includes '' were given . When yes , return false , otherwise return true ; < /li > . < /ul > This implies that includes always have precedence over excludes .
46575	Pushes a new item onto the top of this stack . The pushed item is also returned . This is equivalent to calling < code > add < /code > .
46582	Returns previous node , or throws NullPointerException if null . Use when predecessor can not be null . The null check could be elided , but is present to help the VM .
46583	Register this managed object definition in its parent . < p > This method < b > must not < /b > be called by applications and is only intended for internal testing .
46589	A single preview frame will be returned to the handler supplied . The data will arrive as byte [ ] in the message.obj field , with width and height encoded as message.arg1 and message.arg2 , respectively .
46595	Acquires the write lock for the specified subtree . This method will block if any entry or subtree within the subtree is already read or write locked or if any of the parent entries of the subtree have the subtree write lock taken .
46596	Indicates whether split was forced by new line symbol in rendered text . The value will be set as true if , for example , the rendered text contains '\n ' symbol .
46610	Remove the session from the Manager 's list of active sessions and write it out to the Store . If the session is past its expiration or invalid , this method does nothing .

46622	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
46628	Encodes up to the first three bytes of array < var > threeBytes < /var > and returns a four-byte array in Base64 notation . The actual number of significant bytes in your array is given by < var > numSigBytes < /var > . The array < var > threeBytes < /var > needs only be as big as < var > numSigBytes < /var > . Code can reuse a byte array by passing a four-byte array as < var > b4 < /var > .
46634	Parses the next two bytes from the given byte array as an unsigned short value . As Java does not support unsigned types , we return the value as the least-significant bits of a signed integer . The most-significant 16 bits of the result will always be 0 . Assumes Big-Endian format as in DataInput # readUnsignedShort .
46639	Tests for equality between the specified object and this timestamp . Two timestamps are considered equal if the date and time of their timestamp 's and their signer 's certificate paths are equal .
46641	Adds all objects from one JsonValue to another ( performs a merge ) . Any values contained in both objects will be overwritten to reflect the values in < b > from < /b > < br > < br > < i > < b > NOTE : < /b > this should be a part of JsonValue itself ( so we can support merging two JsonValue objects ) < /i >
46650	Returns a hash code based on the contents of the specified array . If the array contains other arrays as elements , the hash code is based on their identities rather than their contents . It is therefore acceptable to invoke this method on an array that contains itself as an element , either directly or indirectly through one or more levels of arrays . < p > For any two arrays < tt > a < /tt > and < tt > b < /tt > such that < tt > Arrays.equals ( a , b ) < /tt > , it is also the case that < tt > Arrays.hashCode ( a ) == Arrays.hashCode ( b ) < /tt > . < p > The value returned by this method is equal to the value that would be returned by < tt > Arrays.asList ( a ) .hashCode ( ) < /tt > , unless < tt > a < /tt > is < tt > null < /tt > , in which case < tt > 0 < /tt > is returned .
46657	This method generates handler for async methods in REST APIs . The result requires non-empty . If empty , return < em > 404 Not Found < /em > status . The content type is JSON .
46670	Reads the next byte of data from the save buffer or channel buffer . The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255 . If no byte is available in the save buffer or channel buffer , IllegalBlockingModeException will be thrown .
46671	Compares this field descriptor to the specified one . Checks first if one of the compared fields has a primitive type and the other one not . If so , the field with the primitive type is considered to be `` smaller '' . If both fields are equal , their names are compared .
46673	Removes the specified class file transformer from this class loader . It will no longer be able to modify the byte code of any classes loaded by the class loader after the invocation of this method . However , any classes already modified by this transformer will remain transformed .
46696	Writes < code > b.length < /code > bytes from the specified byte array to this output stream . < p > The < code > write < /code > method of < code > CipherOutputStream < /code > calls the < code > write < /code > method of three arguments with the three arguments < code > b < /code > , < code > 0 < /code > , and < code > b.length < /code > .
46703	Adds the specified action listener to receive action events from this list . Action events occur when a user double-clicks on a list item or types Enter when the list has the keyboard focus . < p > If listener < code > l < /code > is < code > null < /code > , no exception is thrown and no action is performed . < p > Refer to < a href= '' doc-files/AWTThreadIssues.html # ListenersThreads '' > AWT Threading Issues < /a > for details on AWT 's threading model .
46704	The JList used for representing the files is created by subclasses , but the selection is monitored in this class . The TransferHandler installed in the JFileChooser is also installed in the file list as it is used as the actual transfer source . The list is updated on a mouse enter to reflect the current data transfer state of the file chooser .
46706	Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the specified collection . If the specified collection is also a set , this operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the < i > asymmetric set difference < /i > of the two sets .
46714	Retrieves the constraints for the specified component . The return value is not a copy , but is the actual < code > GridBagConstraints < /code > object used by the layout mechanism . < p > If < code > comp < /code > is not in the < code > GridBagLayout < /code > , a set of default < code > GridBagConstraints < /code > are returned . A < code > comp < /code > value of < code > null < /code > is invalid and returns < code > null < /code > .
46716	Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the specified collection . If the specified collection is also a set , this operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the < i > asymmetric set difference < /i > of the two sets .
46718	Returns the original string used to create this expression , unmodified . < p > Note to implementors : That returned value must be usable in Expression.valueOf ( ) to create an equivalent Expression ( somehow cloning this instance ) < /p >
46720	Creates and returns an enumeration that traverses the subtree rooted at this node in postorder . The first node returned by the enumeration 's < code > nextElement ( ) < /code > method is the leftmost leaf . This is the same as a depth-first traversal. < P > Modifying the tree by inserting , removing , or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification .
46722	The main parsing method . The XML tree is walked through from the root node and and XMP tree is created . This is a raw parse , the normalisation of the XMP tree happens outside .
46726	Relative read method for reading a UTF-8 encoded string . Reads the next number of specified bytes at this reader 's current position , decoding them into a string using UTF-8 and then increments the position by the number of bytes read . If UTF-8 decoding fails , the platform 's default encoding will be used .

46807	Determines whether each attribute in the attribute set is valid . This method additionally takes the organization name that would be passed to the validation . Iterates though the set checking each element to see if there is a validator that needs to execute .
46809	Returns the next attribute in this < code > SQLInputImpl < /code > object as a stream of ASCII characters . < P > This method does not perform type-safe checking to determine if the returned type is the expected type as this responsibility is delegated to the UDT mapping as implemented by a < code > SQLData < /code > implementation .
46812	The number 's int value . < i > Note : Even though the number 's type might be INTEGER it can be larger than a Java int . Use intValue ( ) only if you are certain that it contains a number from the int range . Otherwise the value might be innaccurate. < /i >
46815	7.2.2 coreSyntaxTerms < br > rdf : RDF | rdf : ID | rdf : about | rdf : parseType | rdf : resource | rdf : nodeID | rdf : datatype
46822	Sets the Authentication Index value to use in the login process . < p > Also checks to see if the AuthIndexType is COMPOSITE and if it is will add another parameter to the request with the same indexValue but using the legacy key `` sunamcompositeadvice '' . This then allows composite advices to work correctly .
46824	Reads unmarshalled data from < code > input < /code > and assigns it to this < code > BooleanHolder < /code > object 's < code > value < /code > field .
46835	Returns < code > true < /code > if this tag is considered to be a paragraph in the internal HTML model . < code > false < /code > - otherwise .

46846	Returns true if this < code > JPasswordField < /code > has a character set for echoing . A character is considered to be set if the echo character is not 0 .
46853	Compares two abstract pathnames lexicographically . The ordering defined by this method depends upon the underlying system . On UNIX systems , alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames ; on Microsoft Windows systems it is not .
46857	Calls the UI delegate 's paint method , if the UI delegate is non- < code > null < /code > . We pass the delegate a copy of the < code > Graphics < /code > object to protect the rest of the paint code from irrevocable changes ( for example , < code > Graphics.translate < /code > ) . < p > If you override this in a subclass you should not make permanent changes to the passed in < code > Graphics < /code > . For example , you should not alter the clip < code > Rectangle < /code > or modify the transform . If you need to do these operations you may find it easier to create a new < code > Graphics < /code > from the passed in < code > Graphics < /code > and manipulate it . Further , if you do not invoker super 's implementation you must honor the opaque property , that is if this component is opaque , you must completely fill in the background in a non-opaque color . If you do not honor the opaque property you will likely see visual artifacts . < p > The passed in < code > Graphics < /code > object might have a transform other than the identify transform installed on it . In this case , you might get unexpected results if you cumulatively apply another transform .
46858	Check if information found in `` cn=admin data '' is coherent with cn=config . If and inconsistency is detected , we log a warning message and update `` cn=admin data ''
46867	Returns the path to request , like the '/ ' in 'GET / HTTP/1.1 ' . Never empty , even if the request URL is . Includes the query component if it exists .

46919	Receive notification of the end of a document . < p > The SAX parser will invoke this method only once , and it will be the last method invoked during the parse . The parser shall not invoke this method until it has either abandoned parsing ( because of an unrecoverable error ) or reached the end of input. < /p >
46928	Returns true if method is page streaming . < p > The heuristic implemented checks if there is some field `` nextPageToken '' within the method 's response type , and returns true if so .
46939	Utility method to determine whether the given point , in local coordinates , is inside the view , where the area of the view is expanded by the slop factor . This method is called while processing touch-move events to determine if the event is still within the view .
46944	Compares this < code > String < /code > to another < code > String < /code > , ignoring case considerations . Two strings are considered equal ignoring case if they are of the same length , and corresponding characters in the two strings are equal ignoring case .
46945	Appends all the elements in the RoleList specified to the end of the list , in the order in which they are returned by the Iterator of the RoleList specified .
46947	< p > Returns a string representation of the object name . The format of this string is not specified , but users can expect that two ObjectNames return the same string if and only if they are equal. < /p >
46948	Prints an exception . It is printed using System.err.println ( ) , so it will go to the `` console '' if you do not redired out/err to a gui . The idea is that if you are tracing and want to see the exception than this MUST work ! .
46953	Determines if this applet is active . An applet is marked active just before its < code > start < /code > method is called . It becomes inactive just before its < code > stop < /code > method is called .
46961	Returns the foo where uuid = & # 63 ; and groupId = & # 63 ; or returns < code > null < /code > if it could not be found . Uses the finder cache .
46970	If the specified component is already a child of this then we do n't bother doing anything - stacking order does n't matter for cell renderer components ( CellRendererPane does n't paint anyway ) .
46992	Called while a drag operation is ongoing , when the mouse pointer enters the operable part of the drop site for the < code > DropTarget < /code > registered with this listener .
46997	Handles a request , that 's not a CORS request , but is a valid request i.e . it is not a cross-origin request . This implementation , just forwards the request down the filter chain .

47029	Receive notification of a non-recoverable error . < p > This corresponds to the definition of `` fatal error '' in section 1.2 of the W3C XML 1.0 Recommendation . For example , a parser would use this callback to report the violation of a well-formedness constraint. < /p > < p > The application must assume that the document is unusable after the parser has invoked this method , and should continue ( if at all ) only for the sake of collecting addition error messages : in fact , SAX parsers are free to stop reporting any other events once this method has been invoked. < /p >
47034	Generic filter rules count as rules that : < br/ > 1 . Do not have a domain specified . `` Hide this element on all domains '' < br/ > 2 . Have only domain exceptions specified . `` Hide this element on all domains except example.com '' < br/ > ~example.com # # .ad ||example.com^ $ third-party
47051	Returns the value of the leadAnchorNotificationEnabled flag . When leadAnchorNotificationEnabled is true the model generates notification events with bounds that cover all the changes to the selection plus the changes to the lead and anchor indices . Setting the flag to false causes a norrowing of the event 's bounds to include only the elements that have been selected or deselected since the last change . Either way , the model continues to maintain the lead and anchor variables internally . The default is true .
47052	Log a message , with no arguments . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the given message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
47065	Retrieves an uppercase representation of the given string . This implementation presumes that the provided string will contain only ASCII characters and is optimized for that case . However , if a non-ASCII character is encountered it will fall back on a more expensive algorithm that will work properly for non-ASCII characters .
47080	Supports reporting constrained property changes . This method can be called when a constrained property has changed and it will send the appropriate < code > PropertyChangeEvent < /code > to any registered < code > VetoableChangeListeners < /code > .
47092	Returns a pool that adaptively decreases its size when idle objects are no longer needed . This is intended as an always thread-safe alternative to using an idle object evictor provided by many pool implementations . This is also an effective way to shrink FIFO ordered pools that experience load spikes . < p > The factor parameter provides a mechanism to tweak the rate at which the pool tries to shrink its size . Values between 0 and 1 cause the pool to try to shrink its size more often . Values greater than 1 cause the pool to less frequently try to shrink its size . < /p >
47111	Returns the TypeCode associated with this DynAny object . A DynAny object is created with a TypeCode value assigned to it . This TypeCode value determines the type of the value handled through the DynAny object . Note that the TypeCode associated with a DynAny object is initialized at the time the DynAny is created and can not be changed during lifetime of the DynAny object .
47116	Return the basic type derived from the erased type of this MT-form . A basic type is erased ( all references Object ) and also has all primitive types ( except int , long , float , double , void ) normalized to int . Such basic types correspond to low-level JVM calling sequences .

If < code > obj < /code > is an exported RMI-IIOP server object , the tie is found and wired to < code > obj < /code > , then written to < code > out.write_Object ( org.omg.CORBA.Object ) < /code > . If < code > obj < /code > is a CORBA Object , it is written to < code > out.write_Object ( org.omg.CORBA.Object ) < /code > .
47129	Determines whether two composite names are equal . If obj is null or not a composite name , false is returned . Two composite names are equal if each component in one is equal to the corresponding component in the other . This implies both have the same number of components , and each component 's equals ( ) test against the corresponding component in the other name returns true .
47142	Returns < tt > false < /tt > if the cookie should be discarded at the end of the `` session '' ; < tt > true < /tt > otherwise .
47143	Inserts line breaks into the provided buffer to wrap text at no more than the specified column width . Wrapping will only be done at space boundaries and if there are no spaces within the specified width , then wrapping will be performed at the first space after the specified column .

47169	Compares the specified Object with this < code > NTPrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns < code > true < /code > if the given object is also a < code > NTPrincipal < /code > and the two < code > NTPrincipal < /code > s have the same user name .
47176	Sets the < code > address < /code > to the < code > W3CEndpointReference < /code > instance 's < code > wsa : Address < /code > . < p > The < code > address < /code > MUST be set to a non- < code > null < /code > value when building a < code > W3CEndpointReference < /code > for a web service endpoint that is not published by the same Java EE application or when running on Java SE .
47179	This method generates handler for async methods in REST DELETE APIs . Return format in JSON ( successful status = 204 ) : < code > { `` message '' : `` delete_success '' } < /code >
47216	Since the converter will use append , it is possible to get chars to be removed from the buffer for `` writing '' . Since the chars have already been read before , they are ignored . If a mark was set , then the mark is lost .
47238	If true , the value of this field should be represented as a rich text string . If the field has a value , the RV entry of the field dictionary specifies the rich text string .
47240	Constructs and throws a WrongNumberArgException with the appropriate message for this function object . This method is meant to be overloaded by derived classes so that the message will be as specific as possible .
47247	Tests whether or not a string matches against a pattern . The pattern may contain two special characters : < br > '* ' means zero or more characters < br > ' ? ' means one and only one character
47250	Writes a < code > char < /code > to the underlying output stream as a 2-byte value , high byte first . If no exception is thrown , the counter < code > written < /code > is incremented by < code > 2 < /code > .

47308	Log a message , with one object parameter . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the given message level then a corresponding LogRecord is created and forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
47312	Receive notification of the end of a Namespace mapping . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the end of each prefix mapping. < /p >
47314	Returns a string representation of this < code > JRadioButtonMenuItem < /code > . This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes , and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations . The returned string may be empty but may not be < code > null < /code > .
47318	Creates a listener that will watch for mouse-press and release events on the combo box . < strong > Warning : < /strong > When overriding this method , make sure to maintain the existing behavior .
47322	Requirements changed along the minor axis . This is called by the thread doing layout for the given ChildState object when it has completed fetching the child views new preferences . Typically this would be the layout thread , but might be the GUI thread if it is trying to update something immediately ( such as to perform a model/view translation ) .
47325	Creates a new DynAny object whose value is a deep copy of the DynAny on which it is invoked . The operation is polymorphic , that is , invoking it on one of the types derived from DynAny , such as DynStruct , creates the derived type but returns its reference as the DynAny base type .
47347	Encodes this CSN into the provided byte string builder . < p > NOTE : this representation must not be modified otherwise interop with earlier protocol versions will be broken .
47356	Translation-time validation of the attributes . Request-time attributes are indicated as such in the TagData parameter . Note that the preferred way to do validation is with the validate ( ) method , since it can return more detailed information .
47366	Requests that this Component get the input focus , and that this Component 's top-level ancestor become the focused Window . This component must be displayable , visible , and focusable for the request to be granted . < p > This method is intended for use by focus implementations .

47386	Allows to update the recovery situation by comparing the CSN of the last change that was sent to the ReplicationServer with the CSN of the last operation that was taken out of the PendingChanges list . If the two match then the recovery is completed and normal procedure can restart . Otherwise the RSUpdater thread must continue to look for older changes and no changes can be committed from the pendingChanges list .
47391	Creating the UI models in the # onRender method makes sure that these fields are not always reinitialized when an actionLink is clicked . This is necessary since Click always creates new instances for actionLink events .
47406	Indicates whether to keep processing entries for the template file . If this is < CODE > false < /CODE > , then LDIF processing will end immediately ( and the current entry will not be included ) .
47407	Reads into an array of bytes . If < code > len < /code > is not zero , the method blocks until some input is available ; otherwise , no bytes are read and < code > 0 < /code > is returned .
47412	Initializes the initial context using the supplied environment . Environment properties are discussed in the class description . < p > This method will modify < tt > environment < /tt > and save a reference to it . The caller may no longer modify it .
47418	This is invoked during a printing operation . This is implemented to invoke < code > paintComponent < /code > on the component . Override this if you wish to add special painting behavior when printing .
47432	Called after a cache miss to compute a value for the corresponding key . Returns the computed value or null if no value can be computed . The default implementation returns null .
47434	Indicates whether requested file path is `` text '' . This is done by comparing file extension to a static list of extensions known to be text . If the file has no file extension , it is also considered to be text .
47449	Gets the attributes specified in the template for all objects at the current level and below which match the search filter in the template . Search behavior is controlled by searchControl . < P >
47451	Log a FINE message , which is only to be constructed if the logging level is such that the message will actually be logged . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the FINE message level then the message is constructed by invoking the provided supplier function and forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
47465	Writes the specified byte to this stream . If the byte is a newline and automatic flushing is enabled then the < code > flush < /code > method will be invoked . < p > Note that the byte is written as given ; to write a character that will be translated according to the platform 's default character encoding , use the < code > print ( char ) < /code > or < code > println ( char ) < /code > methods .
47475	Returns a string representation of this JPanel . This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes , and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations . The returned string may be empty but may not be < code > null < /code > .
47477	Returns the next live successor of p , or null if no such . Unlike other traversal methods , iterators need to handle both : - dequeued nodes ( p.next == p ) - ( possibly multiple ) interior removed nodes ( p.item == null )
47492	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to the specified < code > File < /code > line by line . The specified character encoding and the line ending will be used . < p > NOTE : As from v1.3 , the parent directories of the file will be created if they do not exist .
47504	Configures the instance of OpenAM as provided by the configuration data . In the future we should be able to return an OutputStream that provides the current operation being performed .
47511	Checks whether a character is an HTTP separator . The implementation in this class checks only for the HTTP separators defined in RFC 2616 , section 2.2 . If you need to detect other separators beyond the US-ASCII character set , override this method .
47515	This function is called after everything else has been recomposed , and allows the template to set remaining values that may be based on some other property that depends on recomposition .
47522	Computes the initial value of this thread-local variable for the child thread given the parent thread 's value . Called from the parent thread when creating a child thread . The default implementation returns the parent thread 's value .
47530	Brings up an internal dialog panel where the number of choices is determined by the < code > optionType < /code > parameter , where the < code > messageType < /code > parameter determines the icon to display . The < code > messageType < /code > parameter is primarily used to supply a default icon from the Look and Feel .
47543	Removes the first occurrence of the argument from this vector . If the object is found in this vector , each component in the vector with an index greater or equal to the object 's index is shifted downward to have an index one smaller than the value it had previously .
47544	Searches for roles in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of roles with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
47546	Replaces this SynchronizedRandomAccessList with a SynchronizedList so that JREs before 1.4 can deserialize this object without any problems . This is necessary since RandomAccess API was introduced only in 1.4 . < p >
47575	Decodes an array of quoted-printable characters into an array of original bytes . Escaped characters are converted back to their original representation . < p > This function implements a subset of quoted-printable encoding specification ( rule # 1 and rule # 2 ) as defined in RFC 1521 . < /p >
47586	Messaged from the < code > JSplitPane < /code > the receiver is contained in . May potentially reset the layout manager and cause a < code > validate < /code > to be sent .
47596	Creates an < code > ItemListener < /code > which will be added to the combo box . If this method returns null then it will not be added to the combo box . < p > Subclasses may override this method to return instances of their own ItemEvent handlers .

47610	Writes a < code > Blob < /code > object in the Java programming language to this < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > object . The driver converts it to a serializable < code > SerialBlob < /code > SQL < code > BLOB < /code > value before returning it to the database .
47611	Returns whether this job originating user name attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class JobOriginatingUserName . < LI > This job originating user name attribute 's underlying string and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's underlying string are equal . < LI > This job originating user name attribute 's locale and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's locale are equal . < /OL >
47623	Adds a title to an existing border , with default positioning ( determined by the current look and feel ) , default justification ( leading ) and the default font and text color ( determined by the current look and feel ) .
47627	Adds the specified selected item in the object to the object 's selection . If the object supports multiple selections , the specified item is added to any existing selection , otherwise it replaces any existing selection in the object . If the specified item is already selected , this method has no effect .
47635	Prints this exception 's stack trace to < tt > System.err < /tt > . If this exception has a root exception ; the stack trace of the root exception is printed to < tt > System.err < /tt > instead .

47647	Use this method to set a collection of optional content groups whose states are intended to follow a `` radio button '' paradigm . That is , the state of at most one optional content group in the array should be ON at a time : if one group is turned ON , all others must be turned OFF .
47659	Set a Mark position in this Reader . The parameter < code > readLimit < /code > is ignored for StringReaders . Sending reset ( ) will reposition the reader back to the marked position provided the mark has not been invalidated .
47674	Creates a hash code for this RuleBasedCollationKey . The hash value is calculated on the key itself , not the String from which the key was created . Thus if x and y are RuleBasedCollationKeys , then x.hashCode ( x ) == y.hashCode ( ) if x.equals ( y ) is true . This allows language-sensitive comparison in a hash table . See the CollatinKey class description for an example .
47691	Revert to the previous Namespace context . < p > Normally , you should pop the context at the end of each XML element . After popping the context , all Namespace prefix mappings that were previously in force are restored. < /p > < p > You must not attempt to declare additional Namespace prefixes after popping a context , unless you push another context first. < /p >
47694	Checks if the year is a leap year , according to the ISO proleptic calendar system rules . < p > This method applies the current rules for leap years across the whole time-line . In general , a year is a leap year if it is divisible by four without remainder . However , years divisible by 100 , are not leap years , with the exception of years divisible by 400 which are . < p > For example , 1904 is a leap year it is divisible by 4 . 1900 was not a leap year as it is divisible by 100 , however 2000 was a leap year as it is divisible by 400 . < p > The calculation is proleptic - applying the same rules into the far future and far past . This is historically inaccurate , but is correct for the ISO-8601 standard .
47695	Extract the desired request property , and pass it ( along with the specified request and response objects and associated filter chain ) to the protected < code > process ( ) < /code > method to perform the actual filtering .
47701	Adds a row to the end of the model . The new row will contain < code > null < /code > values unless < code > rowData < /code > is specified . Notification of the row being added will be generated .
47723	If there is some space left , we move footer up , because initially footer will be at the very bottom of the area . We also adjust occupied area by footer size if it is present .
47725	To generate new Brick element in stage . The generated element must be added into < b > SpriteHandler < /b > class 's < em > STAGE_ELEMENTS < /em > list and to the < em > stageContainer < /em > .
47727	Create a blocking promise . NOTE BLOCKING PROMISES ARE FOR LEGACY INTEGRATION AND TESTING ONLY ! ! ! After you create a promise you register its then and catchError and then you use it to handle a callback .
47740	Informally : Ensures that a use of the given reference with the effect of reading or writing a field ( or if an array , element ) of the referenced object , prior to the invocation of this method occur before a subsequent write of the reference . For details , see the class documentation for this class .
47742	Clear the attribute list . < p > SAX parser writers can use this method to reset the attribute list between DocumentHandler.startElement events . Normally , it will make sense to reuse the same AttributeListImpl object rather than allocating a new one each time. < /p >
47751	Enables all the notifications the type of which starts with the specified prefix to be sent to the listener . < BR > If the specified prefix is already in the list of enabled notification types , this method has no effect . < P > Example : < BLOCKQUOTE > < PRE > // Enables all notifications the type of which starts with `` my_example '' to be sent . myFilter.enableType ( `` my_example '' ) ; // Enables all notifications the type of which is `` my_example.my_type '' to be sent . myFilter.enableType ( `` my_example.my_type '' ) ; < /PRE > < /BLOCKQUOTE > Note that : < BLOCKQUOTE > < CODE > myFilter.enableType ( `` my_example . * '' ) ; < /CODE > < /BLOCKQUOTE > will no match any notification type .
47766	< strong > ANDROID INTERPOLATOR < /strong > < br/ > < br/ > An interpolator where the rate of change starts and ends slowly but accelerates through the middle .
47773	Ask whether we support a given DOM feature . In fact , we do not _fully_ support any DOM feature -- we 're a read-only subset -- so arguably we should always return false . Or we could say that we support DOM Core Level 2 but all nodes are read-only . Unclear which answer is least misleading . NON-DOM method . This was present in early drafts of DOM Level 2 , but was renamed isSupported . It 's present here only because it 's cheap , harmless , and might help some poor fool who is still trying to use an early Working Draft of the DOM .
47777	Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the specified collection . If the specified collection is also a set , this operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the < i > asymmetric set difference < /i > of the two sets .
47778	Gets the number of minutes in this duration . < p > This returns the total number of minutes in the duration by dividing the number of seconds by 60 . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .
47780	Receive notification of a recoverable parser error . < p > The default implementation does nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each error , such as inserting the message in a log file or printing it to the console. < /p >
47781	Actions to be taken , when the location of the mouse pointer changes . Default function to be overwritten in derived classes . Returns the return_state of this state , if the state ends after the method , or else this state .
47787	Initializes the access control sub-system . This should only be called at Directory Server startup . If an error occurs then an exception will be thrown and the Directory Server will fail to start ( this prevents accidental exposure of user data due to misconfiguration ) .
47809	Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this queue . Attempts to addAll of a queue to itself result in < tt > IllegalArgumentException < /tt > . Further , the behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress . < p > This implementation iterates over the specified collection , and adds each element returned by the iterator to this queue , in turn . A runtime exception encountered while trying to add an element ( including , in particular , a < tt > null < /tt > element ) may result in only some of the elements having been successfully added when the associated exception is thrown .
47812	Creates the Component to use as the parent of the < code > Popup < /code > . The default implementation creates a < code > Window < /code > , subclasses should override .
47817	Receive notification of the beginning of the document . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the beginning of a document ( such as allocating the root node of a tree or creating an output file ) . < /p >
47828	Writes a log record to the password reset log file . The key to the message to be written is passed in and will be read from the password reset properties file .
47829	Creates the initialize all replication subcommand and all the specific options for the subcommand . Note : this method assumes that initializeGlobalArguments has already been called and that hostNameArg and portArg have been created .
47833	Processes an internal bind operation with the provided information . Note that regardless of whether the bind is successful , the authentication state for this internal connection will not be altered in any way .

47875	Creates and returns a new < code > JDialog < /code > wrapping < code > this < /code > centered on the < code > parentComponent < /code > in the < code > parentComponent < /code > 's frame . < code > title < /code > is the title of the returned dialog . The returned < code > JDialog < /code > will not be resizable by the user , however programs can invoke < code > setResizable < /code > on the < code > JDialog < /code > instance to change this property . The returned < code > JDialog < /code > will be set up such that once it is closed , or the user clicks on one of the buttons , the optionpane 's value property will be set accordingly and the dialog will be closed . Each time the dialog is made visible , it will reset the option pane 's value property to < code > JOptionPane.UNINITIALIZED_VALUE < /code > to ensure the user 's subsequent action closes the dialog properly .
47880	Returns a URL with the hostname and port of the origin server . The path , query , and fragment of this URL are always empty , since they are not significant for planning a route .
47888	Adds the specified selected item in the object to the object 's selection .

48073	Helper method to check if a property is protected or not . We introduce a mechanism to protect certain `` core '' or `` internal '' properties from updates via remote SetProperty method of the SessionService . Allowing remote self-updates to session properties leads to a security vulnerability which allows unconstrained user impersonation or privilege elevation . See bug # 4814922 for more information protectedProperties contains a set of property names which can not be remotely updated . It is initially populated using static initializer . We also implemented an extra safety mechanism intended to protect from accidental reopening of this security hole in the future if a property name changes or new property is introduced without corresponding update of the static hardcoded list of protected properties below . This mechanism automatically adds any property to protectedProperties if it is set via local invocation of putProperty . However , some properties ( such as Locale and CharSet ) must be settable both locally and remotely . In order to make it configurable we use a second table called remotelyUpdateableProperties . Note that protectedProperties takes precedence over remotelyUpdateableProperties : remotelyUpdateableProperties will be consulted only if a property is not on the protectedProperties list already . The following tables defines the behavior of putProperty ( ) and putExternalProperty ( ) depending on whether property name is present in protectedProperties or remotelyUpdateableProperty list protectedProperties remotelyUpdateableProperties putProperty ( ) putExternalProperty ( ) in n/a sets value logs , does nothing out in sets value sets value out out sets value and sets value adds to protectedProperty

48092	Returns true if the specified character is valid . This method also checks the surrogate character range from 0x10000 to 0x10FFFF . < p > If the program chooses to apply the mask directly to the < code > CHARS < /code > array , then they are responsible for checking the surrogate character range .
48093	Adds a new style into the style hierarchy . Style attributes resolve from bottom up so an attribute specified in a child will override an attribute specified in the parent .
48100	See the general contract of the < code > readUTF < /code > method of < code > DataInput < /code > . < p > Bytes for this operation are read from the contained input stream .
48109	Checks all the options parameters and updates the provided LocalizableMessageBuilder with the errors that where encountered . This method assumes that the method parseArguments for the parser has already been called .
48114	Writes the < code > toString ( ) < /code > value of each item in a collection to the specified < code > File < /code > line by line . The default VM encoding and the specified line ending will be used .
48117	In a response , this field 's name `` no-cache '' is misleading . It does n't prevent us from caching the response ; it only means we have to validate the response with the origin server before returning it . We can do this with a conditional GET . < p > In a request , it means do not use a cache to satisfy the request .
48137	Writes a < code > java.sql.Date < /code > object in the Java programming language to this < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > object . The driver converts it to an SQL < code > DATE < /code > before returning it to the database .

48149	Reads a single character from this reader and returns it as an integer with the two higher-order bytes set to 0 . Returns -1 if the end of the reader has been reached . If the pushback buffer does not contain any available characters then a character from the source reader is returned . Blocks until one character has been read , the end of the source reader is detected or an exception is thrown .
48160	Receive notification of a non-recoverable error . < p > This corresponds to the definition of `` fatal error '' in section 1.2 of the W3C XML 1.0 Recommendation . For example , a parser would use this callback to report the violation of a well-formedness constraint. < /p > < p > The application must assume that the document is unusable after the parser has invoked this method , and should continue ( if at all ) only for the sake of collecting addition error messages : in fact , SAX parsers are free to stop reporting any other events once this method has been invoked. < /p >
48161	Loads the attributes into a map . warning : this is lossy for atts that support duplicates like proxyState . but we are n't using those for authentication but only need State , UserName , and UserPassword . So we are good .
48175	Returns true if this component is completely opaque . < p > An opaque component paints every pixel within its rectangular bounds . A non-opaque component paints only a subset of its pixels or none at all , allowing the pixels underneath it to `` show through '' . Therefore , a component that does not fully paint its pixels provides a degree of transparency . < p > Subclasses that guarantee to always completely paint their contents should override this method and return true .
48177	Appends all the elements in the < CODE > AttributeList < /CODE > specified to the end of the list , in the order in which they are returned by the Iterator of the < CODE > AttributeList < /CODE > specified .
48182	Computes a hash code for this abstract pathname . Because equality of abstract pathnames is inherently system-dependent , so is the computation of their hash codes . On UNIX systems , the hash code of an abstract pathname is equal to the exclusive < em > or < /em > of the hash code of its pathname string and the decimal value < code > 1234321 < /code > . On Microsoft Windows systems , the hash code is equal to the exclusive < em > or < /em > of the hash code of its pathname string converted to lower case and the decimal value < code > 1234321 < /code > . Locale is not taken into account on lowercasing the pathname string .
48183	Installs normal borders on all the child components of the JComponent . A normal border is the original border that was installed on the child component before it was added to the toolbar . < p > This is a convenience method to call < code > setBorderNormal < /code > for each child component .

48204	Performs a JAXRPC method call . The parameter < code > functionName < /code > is the JAXRPC function to be called with parameter < code > param < /code > . Returns an object on success , else throws an < code > Exception < /code > .
48208	Compares two strings lexicographically , ignoring case considerations . This method returns an integer whose sign is that of < code > this.toUpperCase ( ) .toLowerCase ( ) .compareTo ( str.toUpperCase ( ) .toLowerCase ( ) ) < /code > . < p > Note that this method does < em > not < /em > take locale into account , and will result in an unsatisfactory ordering for certain locales . The java.text package provides < em > collators < /em > to allow locale-sensitive ordering .
48234	Computes the reciprocal of the input by elevating to the ( 2^255 - 19 ) - 2 efficiently . `` This '' must be a reduced degree , reduced coefficient polynomial .

48256	Receive notification of the end of an element . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the end of each element ( such as finalising a tree node or writing output to a file ) . < /p >
48270	This version of the write request returns false immediately ( without blocking ) if any read or write operations are in progress and a write is n't safe ; otherwise , it returns true and acquires the resource . Use it like this : public void write ( ) { if ( lock.writeRequestImmediate ( ) ) { try { // do the write operation here } finally { lock.writeDone ( ) ; } } else { // could n't write safely . } }
48274	Searches for all roles in this organizational unit using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of all roles with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .

48301	Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method to take specific actions for each chunk of ignorable whitespace ( such as adding data to a node or buffer , or printing it to a file ) . < /p >
48322	Computes the length of this vector < br > < b > Note : < /b > If you are working with raw vectors from PDF , be careful - the Z axis will generally be set to 1 . If you want to compute the length of a vector , subtract it from the origin first ( this will set the Z axis to 0 ) . < br > For example : < code > aVector.subtract ( originVector ) .length ( ) ; < /code >
48324	Process the characters for the < code > read ( char [ ] , offset , length ) < /code > method . < p > This implementation leaves the character array unchanged .

48332	Puts the provided attribute into this entry . If an attribute with the provided type and options already exists , then it will be replaced . If the provided attribute is empty then any existing attribute will be completely removed . < p > This method handles object class replacements but will not perform any object class validation . In particular , it will create default object classes when an object class is unknown . < p > This method implements LDAP modification replace semantics .
48341	Returns the trigonometric sine of an angle . Special cases : < ul > < li > If the argument is NaN or an infinity , then the result is NaN . < li > If the argument is zero , then the result is a zero with the same sign as the argument. < /ul > < p > The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result . Results must be semi-monotonic .

48407	This method returns an Enumeration of permissions in this collection , which is ISPermission in our case . This method gets called internally by java security code , to get all the permissions stored in this permission collection .
48414	Handle a bizarre special case . Nested classes ( static classes declared inside another class ) that are protected have their access bit set to public in their class files to deal with some odd reflection situation . Our SVUID computation must do as the JVM does and ignore access bits in the class file in favor of the access bits InnerClass attribute .
48420	Decide if the given content-type is printable or not . The entity represents a textual/printable content if : < ul > < li > there is a charset associated to the content-type , we 'll be able to print it correctly < /li > < li > the content type is in the category 'text ' or it is an accepted type < /li > < /ul >
48422	Starts a whitespace preserving section . All characters printed within a preserving section are printed without indentation and without consolidating multiple spaces .

48437	Submits the populated < code > Callback < /code > objects to the authentication plug-in modules . Called after < code > getRequirements < /code > method and obtaining user 's response to these requests .
48448	Prints warning messages only when debug level is greater than DEBUG.ERROR . < p > < b > NOTE : < /b > Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused . Particularly , note that Java evaluates arguments to < code > warning ( ) < /code > even when debugging is turned off . It is recommended that the debug state be checked by invoking < code > warningEnabled ( ) < /code > before invoking any < code > warning ( ) < /code > methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and to maximize application performance. < /p > < p > If the debug file is not accessible and debugging is enabled , the message along with a time stamp and thread info will be printed on < code > System.out < /code > . < /p > < p > This method creates the debug file if does not exist ; otherwise it starts appending to the existing debug file . When invoked for the first time on this object , the method writes a line delimiter of '*'s. < /p > < p > Note that the debug file will remain open until < code > destroy ( ) < /code > is invoked . To conserve file resources , you should invoke < code > destroy ( ) < /code > explicitly rather than wait for the garbage collector to clean up. < /p >
48454	Copies all of the mappings from the specified Map to this provider . These mappings will replace any properties that this provider had for any of the keys currently in the specified Map .
48456	Called when the UI is uninstalling . Since this popup is n't in the component tree , it wo n't get it 's uninstallUI ( ) called . It removes the listeners that were added in addComboBoxListeners ( ) .
48460	Composes the name of this context with a name relative to this context . Since an initial context may never be named relative to any context other than itself , the value of the < tt > prefix < /tt > parameter must be an empty name .

48507	Returns the resulting multicast listener after removing the old listener from listener-l . If listener-l equals the old listener OR listener-l is null , returns null . Else if listener-l is an instance of AWTEventMulticaster , then it removes the old listener from it . Else , returns listener l .
48523	Returns a string representation of this < code > ArrayType < /code > instance . < p > The string representation consists of the name of this class ( i.e . < code > javax.management.openmbean.ArrayType < /code > ) , the type name , the dimension , the elements ' open type and the primitive array flag defined for this instance . < p > As < code > ArrayType < /code > instances are immutable , the string representation for this instance is calculated once , on the first call to < code > toString < /code > , and then the same value is returned for subsequent calls .
48533	Create an object , and place it into the pool . addObject ( ) is useful for `` pre-loading '' a pool with idle objects . < p > If there is no capacity available to add to the pool , this is a no-op ( no exception , no impact to the pool ) . < /p >
48543	Report a fatal XML parsing error . < p > The default implementation throws a SAXParseException . Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they need to take specific actions for each fatal error ( such as collecting all of the errors into a single report ) : in any case , the application must stop all regular processing when this method is invoked , since the document is no longer reliable , and the parser may no longer report parsing events. < /p >
48546	Determine if a zone is in the loaded state . The zones are expected to represent a subset of the child elements of the element this view is responsible for . Therefore , the default implementation is to return true if the view has children .

48580	Returns < tt > true < /tt > if and only if this < tt > TabularData < /tt > instance contains a < tt > CompositeData < /tt > value ( ie a row ) whose index is the specified < var > key < /var > . If < var > key < /var > can not be cast to a one dimension array of Object instances , this method simply returns < tt > false < /tt > ; otherwise it returns the the result of the call to < tt > this.containsKey ( ( Object [ ] ) key ) < /tt > .
48598	Reads the next byte of data from this input stream . The byte is returned as an < code > int < /code > in the range < code > 0 < /code > to < code > 255 < /code > . If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached , the value < code > -1 < /code > is returned . This method blocks until input data is available , the end of the stream is detected , or an exception is thrown . < p > This method tries to read one character from the current substream . If it reaches the end of the stream , it calls the < code > close < /code > method of the current substream and begins reading from the next substream .

48668	Receive notification of the beginning of the document . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the beginning of a document ( such as allocating the root node of a tree or creating an output file ) . < /p >
48671	Method expected to be overridden by subclasses to append detail beyond attribute type name . Used by logging to portray attribute field structure when logging packet traffic if special handling is required for a given field distinct from that provided by the super class .
48679	Checks if the year is a leap year , according to the ISO proleptic calendar system rules . < p > This method applies the current rules for leap years across the whole time-line . In general , a year is a leap year if it is divisible by four without remainder . However , years divisible by 100 , are not leap years , with the exception of years divisible by 400 which are . < p > For example , 1904 is a leap year it is divisible by 4 . 1900 was not a leap year as it is divisible by 100 , however 2000 was a leap year as it is divisible by 400 . < p > The calculation is proleptic - applying the same rules into the far future and far past . This is historically inaccurate , but is correct for the ISO-8601 standard .
48690	Adds the specified < code > DragSourceListener < /code > to this < code > DragSource < /code > to receive drag source events during drag operations intiated with this < code > DragSource < /code > .

48698	Gets the number of days in this duration . < p > This returns the total number of days in the duration by dividing the number of seconds by 86400 . This is based on the standard definition of a day as 24 hours . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .
48705	This method checks if a given character either NEL ( 0x85 ) or LSEP ( 0x2028 ) These are new end of line charcters added in XML 1.1 . These characters must be written as Numeric Character References ( NCR ) in XML 1.1 output document .
48711	Compares two DynAny values for equality . Two DynAny values are equal if their TypeCodes are equivalent and , recursively , all component DynAnys have equal values . The current position of the two DynAnys being compared has no effect on the result of equal .
48713	The indexOf ( ) method returns the index within the calling String of the first occurrence of the specified value , starting the search at fromIndex . Returns -1 if the value is not found .
48714	If we detect we need to operate in CREST 2.0 compatibility mode , then return the remaining number of items in the query . Otherwise , the response will always contain the total results available .

48744	< p > Called by the QuartzScheduler before the < code > JobStore < /code > is used , in order to give the it a chance to initialize . < /p >
48748	Compares this object to the specified enum object to determine their relative order . This method compares the object 's ordinal values , that is , their position in the enum declaration .
48750	Determines whether the existing managed object which is about to be deleted from the server configuration satisfies this constraint . < p > If the constraint is not satisfied , the implementation must return < code > false < /code > and add a message describing why the constraint was not satisfied . < p > The default implementation is to return < code > true < /code > .
48755	Creates a new domain from its configEntry , do the necessary initialization and starts it so that it is fully operational when this method returns . It is only used for tests so far .
48757	Creates an any value from a DynAny object . A copy of the TypeCode associated with the DynAny object is assigned to the resulting any . The value associated with the DynAny object is copied into the any .
48768	Returns whether this printer message from operator attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class PrinterMessageFromOperator . < LI > This printer message from operator attribute 's underlying string and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's underlying string are equal . < LI > This printer message from operator attribute 's locale and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's locale are equal . < /OL >
48772	Publishes an event with details of the successfully completed configuration deletion operation , if the 'config ' topic is audited . < p/ > Any exception that occurs while trying to publish the audit event will be captured in the debug logs but otherwise ignored .
48780	Creates a new entry for the null key , and the given value and inserts it into the hash table . This method is called by put ( and indirectly , putAll ) , and overridden by LinkedHashMap .
48785	Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class Class , with an optional CodeSource . Before the class can be used it must be resolved . < p > If a non-null CodeSource is supplied a ProtectionDomain is constructed and associated with the class being defined . < p >
48789	Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it is being reclaimed and that it should destroy any resources that it has allocated . The < code > stop < /code > method will always be called before < code > destroy < /code > . < p > A subclass of < code > Applet < /code > should override this method if it has any operation that it wants to perform before it is destroyed . For example , an applet with threads would use the < code > init < /code > method to create the threads and the < code > destroy < /code > method to kill them . < p > The implementation of this method provided by the < code > Applet < /code > class does nothing .
48805	Registers the specified < code > FlavorListener < /code > to receive < code > FlavorEvent < /code > s from this clipboard . If < code > listener < /code > is < code > null < /code > , no exception is thrown and no action is performed .
48818	Redoes the appropriate edits . If < code > end < /code > has been invoked this calls through to the superclass . Otherwise this invokes < code > redo < /code > on all edits between the index of the next edit and the next significant edit , updating the index of the next edit appropriately .
48823	Obtains and ignores the next task that the executor would otherwise execute , if one is immediately available , and then retries execution of task r , unless the executor is shut down , in which case task r is instead discarded .
48838	Returns a copy of this period with the specified months added . < p > This adds the amount to the months unit in a copy of this period . The years and days units are unaffected . For example , `` 1 year , 6 months and 3 days '' plus 2 months returns `` 1 year , 8 months and 3 days '' . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .
48899	Build an AppEventsLogger instance to log events through . The Facebook app that these events are targeted at comes from this application 's metadata . The application ID used to log events will be determined from the app ID specified in the package metadata .
48909	Erase a purchase ( locally ) from the inventory , given its product ID . This just modifies the Inventory object locally and has no effect on the server ! This is useful when you have an existing Inventory object which you know to be up to date , and you have just consumed an item successfully , which means that erasing its purchase data from the Inventory you already have is quicker than querying for a new Inventory .
48940	An object serialized in a version of the API before Descriptors were added to this class will have an empty or null Descriptor . For consistency with our behavior in this version , we must replace the object with one where the Descriptors reflect the same value of returned openType .
48941	Finalizes static variables on shutdown so that we release the memory associated with them ( for the unit tests ) and get fresh copies if we 're doing an in-core restart .
48942	Initialize ( or configure ) the < code > Subject < /code > object . Usually it will be initialized with the environment paramaters set by the system administrator via SMS . For example in a Role implementation , the configuration parameters could specify the directory server name , port , etc .
48949	Generates a resource response for an issued token . The ID of the resource will be a random UUID , and the revision is the base-64 encoded SHA-1 hash of the assertion . The content of the resource is a JSON object with a single field `` issued_token '' whose content is the issued token assertion .
48950	Removes the first occurrence of the specified element in this list ( when traversing the list from head to tail ) . If the list does not contain the element , it is unchanged .
48959	Display the dialog , adding the fragment to the given FragmentManager . This is a convenience for explicitly creating a transaction , adding the fragment to it with the given tag , and committing it . This does < em > not < /em > add the transaction to the back stack . When the fragment is dismissed , a new transaction will be executed to remove it from the activity .
48971	Returns the `` restart '' boolean argument . < br > < i > N.B : the ' R ' short option is also used by rejectfile , serverRoot. < /i >
48976	Navigate to the conversations list view . Note that , the conversations list view is provided only for demonstration purposes . For anonymous meeting join it will always have a single conversation after meeting join is successful .
48982	Identifies a field to be of common use. < br > Some software may differ between common and not common fields . A common one is for sure the title field . A web link may not be of common use for tagging . However some file formats , or future development of users expectations will make more fields common than now can be known .
48984	Compares two activation ids for content equality . Returns true if both of the following conditions are true : 1 ) the unique identifiers equivalent ( by content ) , and 2 ) the activator specified in each identifier refers to the same remote object .
49001	Removes a set of attributes for the element . If any of the attributes is a StyleConstants attribute , the request will be converted to a CSS attribute prior to forwarding to the superclass behavior .
49003	Encodes up to the first three bytes of array < var > threeBytes < /var > and returns a four-byte array in Base64 notation . The actual number of significant bytes in your array is given by < var > numSigBytes < /var > . The array < var > threeBytes < /var > needs only be as big as < var > numSigBytes < /var > . Code can reuse a byte array by passing a four-byte array as < var > b4 < /var > .
49006	Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the value part of at least one of the key properties . < p > For example , `` d : k=* '' and `` d : k=* , * '' are property value patterns whereas `` d : k=v , * '' is not .
49014	Writes out a < code > byte < /code > to the underlying output stream as a 1-byte value . If no exception is thrown , the counter < code > written < /code > is incremented by < code > 1 < /code > .
49016	Accepts the drag . This method should be called from a < code > DropTargetListeners < /code > < code > dragEnter < /code > , < code > dragOver < /code > , and < code > dropActionChanged < /code > methods if the implementation wishes to accept an operation from the srcActions other than the one selected by the user as represented by the < code > dropAction < /code > .
49020	Verifies that the digests stored in the manifest match the decrypted digests from the .SF file . This indicates the validity of the signing , not the integrity of the file , as it 's digest must be calculated and verified when its contents are read .
49027	Execute this SQL statement , if it is not a SELECT / INSERT / DELETE / UPDATE , for example CREATE / DROP table , view , trigger , index etc .
49032	Adds a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list . The listener is registered for all bound properties of this class . < p > If < code > listener < /code > is < code > null < /code > , no exception is thrown and no action is performed .
49034	Reorder the objects in the array into visual order based on their levels . This is a utility function to use when you have a collection of objects representing runs of text in logical order , each run containing text at a single level . The elements at < code > index < /code > from < code > objectStart < /code > up to < code > objectStart + count < /code > in the objects array will be reordered into visual order assuming each run of text has the level indicated by the corresponding element in the levels array ( at < code > index - objectStart + levelStart < /code > ) .
49040	Return the first node out of the nodeset , if this expression is a nodeset expression . This is the default implementation for nodesets . Derived classes should try and override this and return a value without having to do a clone operation .
49051	Calls < code > paint < /code > . Does n't clear the background but see < code > ComponentUI.update < /code > , which is called by < code > paintComponent < /code > .
49060	Returns an immutable list consisting of < tt > n < /tt > copies of the specified object . The newly allocated data object is tiny ( it contains a single reference to the data object ) . This method is useful in combination with the < tt > List.addAll < /tt > method to grow lists . The returned list is serializable .
49070	Tell if the node is ignorable whitespace . Note that this can be determined only in the context of a DTD or other Schema , and that DOM Level 2 has nostandardized DOM API which can return that information .
49077	Indicates whether this worker thread is actively processing a request . Note that this is a point-in-time determination and if a reliable answer is expected then the server should impose some external constraint to ensure that no new requests are enqueued .
49092	Build the value for the aci from the specified fields . This is a bit of a kludge , but it does help us from having nested `` \ '' '' , and it does allow us to more easily generate combinations of acis .
49093	Determines whether the specified RDN sequence forms a prefix of this LDAP name . Returns true if this LdapName is at least as long as rdns , and for every position p in the range [ 0 , rdns.size ( ) ) the component getRdn ( p ) matches rdns.get ( p ) . Returns false otherwise . If rdns is null , false is returned .
49109	Given a node handle , test if it has child nodes . < p > % REVIEW % This is obviously useful at the DOM layer , where it would permit testing this without having to create a proxy node . It 's less useful in the DTM API , where ( dtm.getFirstChild ( nodeHandle ) ! =DTM.NULL ) is just as fast and almost as self-evident . But it 's a convenience , and eases porting of DOM code to DTM . < /p >
49131	Mark the present position in the stream . Subsequent calls to reset ( ) will attempt to reposition the stream to this point . Not all character-input streams support the mark ( ) operation .
49145	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
49155	Sent when the tree has changed enough that we need to resize the bounds , but not enough that we need to remove the expanded node set ( e.g nodes were expanded or collapsed , or nodes were inserted into the tree ) . You should never have to invoke this , the UI will invoke this as it needs to .
49164	Returns true if this node has no children . To distinguish between nodes that have no children and nodes that < i > can not < /i > have children ( e.g . to distinguish files from empty directories ) , use this method in conjunction with < code > getAllowsChildren < /code >
49169	Close the stream . Once a stream has been closed , further read ( ) , ready ( ) , mark ( ) , or reset ( ) invocations will throw an IOException . Closing a previously-closed stream , however , has no effect .
49176	Sleeps for the specified time . To catch any < code > InterruptedException < /code > s that occur , < code > Thread.sleep ( ) < /code > may be used instead .
49182	Start a new Namespace context . < p > Normally , you should push a new context at the beginning of each XML element : the new context will automatically inherit the declarations of its parent context , but it will also keep track of which declarations were made within this context. < /p > < p > The Namespace support object always starts with a base context already in force : in this context , only the `` xml '' prefix is declared. < /p >
49186	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object . It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy ( ) to avoid resource leaks . Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid . Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST . It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained .
49187	A simple minded look and feel change : ask each node in the tree to < code > updateUI ( ) < /code > -- that is , to initialize its UI property with the current look and feel .
49207	Compares the specified Object with this < code > JMXPrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns true if the given object is also a < code > JMXPrincipal < /code > and the two JMXPrincipals have the same name . < p >
49211	Returns a readable channel on the given input stream . The resulting channel has the following properties : < ul > < li > If the channel is closed , then the underlying stream is closed as well. < /li > < li > It is not buffered. < /li > < /ul >
49222	Prints the stack trace of the root exception to a PrintWriter Also prints the messages of all the exceptions starting from top exception to the root exception , at the top of stack trace
49243	Creates a new font program . This font program can be one of the 14 built in fonts , a Type 1 font referred to by an AFM or PFM file , a TrueType font ( simple only ) or a CJK font from the Adobe Asian Font Pack . TrueType fonts and CJK fonts can have an optional style modifier appended to the name . These modifiers are : Bold , Italic and BoldItalic . An example would be `` STSong-Light , Bold '' . Note that this modifiers do not work if the font is embedded . Fonts in TrueType Collections are addressed by index such as `` msgothic.ttc,1 '' . This would get the second font ( indexes start at 0 ) , in this case `` MS PGothic '' . < p/ > The fonts are cached and if they already exist they are extracted from the cache , not parsed again . < p/ >
49259	Changes the placement side of the component the component with numberp_component_no and mirrors it at the vertical line through p_pole . Works contrary to Component.change_side the undo algorithm of the board .
49264	Do what necessary when the data have changed : load state , load generation Id . If there is no such information check if there is a ReplicaUpdateVector entry and translate it into a state and generationId .
49284	Tell if the character argument that is from a text node has a mapping to a String , for example to map ' < ' to `` & lt ; '' .
49287	This hook is called whenever the options menu is being closed ( either by the user canceling the menu with the back/menu button , or when an item is selected ) .
49294	Creates a new attribute with the specified attribute name and no attribute values . < p > If the attribute name can not be found in the schema , a new attribute type is created using the default attribute syntax .
49303	Decodes an Object using the base64 algorithm . This method is provided in order to satisfy the requirements of the Decoder interface , and will throw a DecoderException if the supplied object is not of type byte [ ] .
49319	Returns the number of components of a DynAny . For a DynAny without components , it returns zero . The operation only counts the components at the top level . For example , if component_count is invoked on a DynStruct with a single member , the return value is 1 , irrespective of the type of the member . < UL > < LI > For sequences , the operation returns the current number of elements . < LI > For structures , exceptions , and value types , the operation returns the number of members . < LI > For arrays , the operation returns the number of elements . < LI > For unions , the operation returns 2 if the discriminator indicates that a named member is active , otherwise , it returns 1 . < LI > For DynFixed and DynEnum , the operation returns zero . < /UL >
49324	Removes any attribute for this category from this attribute set if present . If < CODE > category < /CODE > is null , then < CODE > remove ( ) < /CODE > does nothing and returns < tt > false < /tt > .
49327	Removes the < code > Subject < /code > object identified by object 's < code > equals < /code > method . If a subject instance does not exist , the method will return silently .
49330	Convenience method that invokes one of < code > undo < /code > or < code > redo < /code > . If any edits have been undone ( the index of the next edit is less than the length of the edits list ) this invokes < code > redo < /code > , otherwise it invokes < code > undo < /code > .
49336	Inserts item x at position k , maintaining heap invariant by promoting x up the tree until it is greater than or equal to its parent , or is the root . To simplify and speed up coercions and comparisons . the Comparable and Comparator versions are separated into different methods that are otherwise identical . ( Similarly for siftDown . )
49339	Returns the maximum number of bytes that can be read ( or skipped over ) from this audio input stream without blocking . This limit applies only to the next invocation of a < code > read < /code > or < code > skip < /code > method for this audio input stream ; the limit can vary each time these methods are invoked . Depending on the underlying stream , an IOException may be thrown if this stream is closed .
49340	Indicates whether the provided object is equal to this byte string . In order for it to be considered equal , the provided object must be a byte sequence containing the same bytes in the same order .
49354	Compose the path expression to select an alternate item by language . The path syntax allows two forms of & quot ; content addressing & quot ; that may be used to select an item in an array of alternatives . The form used in ComposeLangSelector lets you select an item in an alt-text array based on the value of its < tt > xml : lang < /tt > qualifier . The other form of content addressing is shown in ComposeFieldSelector . \note ComposeLangSelector does not supplant SetLocalizedText or GetLocalizedText . They should generally be used , as they provide extra logic to choose the appropriate language and maintain consistency with the ' x-default ' value . ComposeLangSelector gives you an path expression that is explicitly and only for the language given in the langName parameter .
49369	Close the stream . Once a stream has been closed , further read ( ) , ready ( ) , mark ( ) , or reset ( ) invocations will throw an IOException . Closing a previously-closed stream , however , has no effect .
49370	Copies the specified array , truncating or padding with zeros ( if necessary ) so the copy has the specified length . For all indices that are valid in both the original array and the copy , the two arrays will contain identical values . For any indices that are valid in the copy but not the original , the copy will contain < tt > 0d < /tt > . Such indices will exist if and only if the specified length is greater than that of the original array .
49378	Finds the implementation Class object in the specified order . The specified order is the following : < ol > < li > query the system property using < code > System.getProperty < /code > < li > read < code > $ java.home/lib/ < i > propertiesFilename < /i > < /code > file < li > read < code > META-INF/services/ < i > factoryId < /i > < /code > file < li > use fallback classname < /ol >
49379	Searches for organizational units in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of organizational units with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
49390	Removes the mapping for this key from this map if it is present ( optional operation ) . More formally , if this map contains a mapping from key < tt > k < /tt > to value < tt > v < /tt > such that < code > ( key==null ? k==null : key.equals ( k ) ) < /code > , that mapping is removed . ( The map can contain at most one such mapping . ) < p > Returns the value to which the map previously associated the key , or < tt > null < /tt > if the map contained no mapping for this key . ( A < tt > null < /tt > return can also indicate that the map previously associated < tt > null < /tt > with the specified key if the implementation supports < tt > null < /tt > values . ) The map will not contain a mapping for the specified key once the call returns .
49394	Returns set of string . This is a convenient method for adding a set of string into a map . In this project , we usually have the < code > Map & lt ; String , Set & lt ; String & gt ; & gt ; and many times , we just want to add a string to the map .
49405	This function is called after everything else has been recomposed , and allows the template to set remaining values that may be based on some other property that depends on recomposition .
49406	Removes the remote object , obj , from the RMI runtime . If successful , the object can no longer accept incoming RMI calls . If the force parameter is true , the object is forcibly unexported even if there are pending calls to the remote object or the remote object still has calls in progress . If the force parameter is false , the object is only unexported if there are no pending or in progress calls to the object .
49409	Adds p_object to the UndoableObjectsList A check is made to make sure that p_object is non null By doing this I am guarantee that a get will always return a non null object
49410	Compares the specified Attributes object with this Map for equality . Returns true if the given object is also an instance of Attributes and the two Attributes objects represent the same mappings .
49416	Mark the present position in the stream . Subsequent calls to reset ( ) will attempt to reposition the stream to this point . Not all character-input streams support the mark ( ) operation .
49424	Returns true if this node is a marker . This method is n't actually called in any current code checking for markers because callers will have already read value field and need to use that read ( not another done here ) and so directly test if value points to node .
49446	Delete does nothing further other than to forward the request on . This results in any associated resource type being left orphaned if it is not used by any other application .
49457	Compares the specified object with this set for equality . Returns < tt > true < /tt > if the given object is also a set , the two sets have the same size , and every member of the given set is contained in this set .
49504	Returns the < code > index < /code > th item in the collection . If < code > index < /code > is greater than or equal to the number of nodes in the list , this returns < code > null < /code > .
49523	Installs the < code > DefaultFormatter < /code > onto a particular < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > . This will invoke < code > valueToString < /code > to convert the current value from the < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > to a String . This will then install the < code > Action < /code > s from < code > getActions < /code > , the < code > DocumentFilter < /code > returned from < code > getDocumentFilter < /code > and the < code > NavigationFilter < /code > returned from < code > getNavigationFilter < /code > onto the < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > . < p > Subclasses will typically only need to override this if they wish to install additional listeners on the < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > . < p > If there is a < code > ParseException < /code > in converting the current value to a String , this will set the text to an empty String , and mark the < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > as being in an invalid state . < p > While this is a public method , this is typically only useful for subclassers of < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > . < code > JFormattedTextField < /code > will invoke this method at the appropriate times when the value changes , or its internal state changes .
49547	Add a child to the child list . < ! ELEMENT xsl : apply-templates ( xsl : sort|xsl : with-param ) * > < ! ATTLIST xsl : apply-templates select % expr ; `` node ( ) '' mode % qname ; # IMPLIED >
49565	Apply the given pattern to this Format object . The pattern is assumed to be in a localized notation . A pattern is a short-hand specification for the various formatting properties . These properties can also be changed individually through the various setter methods . < p > There is no limit to integer digits set by this routine , since that is the typical end-user desire ; use setMaximumInteger if you want to set a real value . For negative numbers , use a second pattern , separated by a semicolon < P > Example < code > '' # , # 00.0 # '' < /code > & rarr ; 1,234.56 < P > This means a minimum of 2 integer digits , 1 fraction digit , and a maximum of 2 fraction digits . < p > Example : < code > '' # , # 00.0 # ; ( # , # 00.0 # ) '' < /code > for negatives in parentheses . < p > In negative patterns , the minimum and maximum counts are ignored ; these are presumed to be set in the positive pattern .
49573	Returns true if this node is a marker . This method is n't actually called in any current code checking for markers because callers will have already read value field and need to use that read ( not another done here ) and so directly test if value points to node .
49577	Returns an iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence . < p > The returned iterator is < a href= '' # fail-fast '' > < i > fail-fast < /i > < /a > .
49599	Decrements the iterator 's index by one and returns the character at the new index . If the current index is getBeginIndex ( ) , the index remains at getBeginIndex ( ) and a value of DONE is returned .
49612	Log a message , with associated Throwable information . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the given message level then the given arguments are stored in a LogRecord which is forwarded to all registered output handlers . < p > Note that the thrown argument is stored in the LogRecord thrown property , rather than the LogRecord parameters property . Thus it is processed specially by output Formatters and is not treated as a formatting parameter to the LogRecord message property . < p >
49613	Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map . This result is a snapshot , and may not reflect unprocessed entries that will be removed before next attempted access because they are no longer referenced .
49615	Attempts to match the entire region against the pattern . < p > If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the < tt > start < /tt > , < tt > end < /tt > , and < tt > group < /tt > methods . < /p >
49624	Conditionally execute a sub-template . The expression is evaluated and the resulting object is converted to a boolean as if by a call to the boolean function . If the result is true , then the content template is instantiated ; otherwise , nothing is created .
49639	Adds a single RDN at a specified position within this LDAP name . RDNs of this LDAP name at or after the index ( if any ) of the new RDN are shifted up by one ( away from index 0 ) to accommodate the new RDN .
49657	Processes text events occurring on this text component by dispatching them to any registered < code > TextListener < /code > objects . < p > NOTE : This method will not be called unless text events are enabled for this component . This happens when one of the following occurs : < ul > < li > A < code > TextListener < /code > object is registered via < code > addTextListener < /code > < li > Text events are enabled via < code > enableEvents < /code > < /ul > < p > Note that if the event parameter is < code > null < /code > the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception .
49661	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
49662	Ensures that the BitSet can accommodate a given wordIndex , temporarily violating the invariants . The caller must restore the invariants before returning to the user , possibly using recalculateWordsInUse ( ) .
49665	The real paint behavior occurs naturally from the association that the component has with its parent container ( the same container hosting this view ) . This is implemented to do nothing .
49669	Receive notification of the start of a Namespace mapping . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the start of each Namespace prefix scope ( such as storing the prefix mapping ) . < /p >
49689	Relative read method for reading a long value . Reads the next eight bytes at this reader 's current position , composing them into a long value according to big-endian byte order , and then increments the position by eight .
49692	Renders using the given rendering surface and area on that surface . The view may need to do layout and create child views to enable itself to render into the given allocation .
49700	Marks the current position in this input stream . < p > The < code > mark < /code > method of < code > PushbackInputStream < /code > does nothing .
49705	generate a signed object that for a CMS Signed Data object using the given provider - if encapsulate is true a copy of the message will be included in the signature with the default content type `` data '' .
49707	Supports deferred automatic layout . < p > Calls < code > invalidate < /code > and then adds this component 's < code > validateRoot < /code > to a list of components that need to be validated . Validation will occur after all currently pending events have been dispatched . In other words after this method is called , the first validateRoot ( if any ) found when walking up the containment hierarchy of this component will be validated . By default , < code > JRootPane < /code > , < code > JScrollPane < /code > , and < code > JTextField < /code > return true from < code > isValidateRoot < /code > . < p > This method will automatically be called on this component when a property value changes such that size , location , or internal layout of this component has been affected . This automatic updating differs from the AWT because programs generally no longer need to invoke < code > validate < /code > to get the contents of the GUI to update .
49736	Obtains a variable value range . < p > This factory obtains a range where the minimum value is fixed and the maximum value may vary . For example , the ISO day-of-month always starts at 1 , but ends between 28 and 31 .
49743	Returns the authorization challenges appropriate for this response 's code . If the response code is 401 unauthorized , this returns the `` WWW-Authenticate '' challenges . If the response code is 407 proxy unauthorized , this returns the `` Proxy-Authenticate '' challenges . Otherwise this returns an empty list of challenges .
49749	Returns a string representation of this < code > JEditorPane < /code > . This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes , and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations . The returned string may be empty but may not be < code > null < /code > .
49753	Initialize ( or configure ) the < code > Subject < /code > object . Usually it will be initialized with the environment parameters set by the system administrator using configuration service . For example in a Role implementation , the configuration parameters could specify the directory server name , port , etc .
49757	Flush the Introspector 's internal cached information for a given class . This method is not normally required . It is normally only needed by advanced tools that update existing `` Class '' objects in-place and need to make the Introspector re-analyze an existing Class object . Note that only the direct state associated with the target Class object is flushed . We do not flush state for other Class objects with the same name , nor do we flush state for any related Class objects ( such as subclasses ) , even though their state may include information indirectly obtained from the target Class object .
49769	Creates a set of offset/span pairs representing how to lay out a set of components end-to-end . This method requires that you specify the total amount of space to be allocated , the size requirements for each component to be placed ( specified as an array of SizeRequirements ) , and the total size requirement of the set of components . You can get the total size requirement by invoking the getTiledSizeRequirements method . The components will be tiled in the forward direction with offsets increasing from 0 .
49772	Compares this Aci with the provided Aci based on a natural order . This order will be first hierarchical ( ancestors will come before descendants ) and then alphabetical by attribute name ( s ) and value ( s ) .
49773	Advances the current position to the next component . The operation returns true while the resulting current position indicates a component , false otherwise . A false return value leaves the current position at -1 . Invoking next on a DynAny without components leaves the current position at -1 and returns false .
49793	Writes a < code > float < /code > in the Java programming language to this < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > object . The driver converts it to an SQL < code > REAL < /code > before returning it to the database .
49796	Add the supplied ApplicationInfo objects to the list , and enqueue it into the list to broadcast when notify ( ) is called . If the app is already in the list , does n't add it .
49800	Retrieves the < code > TypeCode < /code > object that corresponds to the value held in this < code > IntHolder < /code > object 's < code > value < /code > field .
49802	Write a serialized version of this session object to the specified object output stream . < p > < b > IMPLEMENTATION NOTE < /b > : The owning Manager will not be stored in the serialized representation of this Session . After calling < code > readObject ( ) < /code > , you must set the associated Manager explicitly . < p > < b > IMPLEMENTATION NOTE < /b > : Any attribute that is not Serializable will be unbound from the session , with appropriate actions if it implements HttpSessionBindingListener . If you do not want any such attributes , be sure the < code > distributable < /code > property of the associated Manager is set to < code > true < /code > .
49804	When we bind the widget , we should notify the widget that the size has changed if we have not done so already ( only really for default workspace widgets ) .
49806	Handle onNewIntent ( ) to inform the fragment manager that the state is not saved . If you are handling new intents and may be making changes to the fragment state , you want to be sure to call through to the super-class here first . Otherwise , if your state is saved but the activity is not stopped , you could get an onNewIntent ( ) call which happens before onResume ( ) and trying to perform fragment operations at that point will throw IllegalStateException because the fragment manager thinks the state is still saved .
49813	Handles authentication requests from HTTP POST . Will then either create or retrieve the Login Process , dependent on if the request is a new authentication request or a continuation of one .
49841	Report an XML comment anywhere in the document . This callback will be used for comments inside or outside the document element , including comments in the external DTD subset ( if read ) .
49842	Causes the Directory Server to perform an in-core restart . This will cause virtually all components of the Directory Server to shut down , and once that has completed it will be restarted .
49844	Performs any post-delete processing required by this constraint . This method is invoked after a managed object has been accepted for deletion from the server 's configuration . < p > The default implementation is to do nothing .
49846	As of Java 2 platform v1.3 this method is no longer used . Subclassers previously using this method should instead create an Action wrapping the ActionListener , and register that Action by overriding < code > installKeyboardActions < /code > and placing the Action in the SplitPane 's ActionMap . Please refer to the key bindings specification for further details . < p > Creates a ActionListener for the JSplitPane UI that listens for specific key presses .
49847	Generates a valid ASCII property list in GnuStep format which has this NSDictionary as its root object . The generated property list complies with the format as described in < a href= '' http : //www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/Developer/Base/Reference/NSPropertyList.html '' > GnuStep - NSPropertyListSerialization class documentation < /a >
49857	Initializes a memory-based backend that may be used to perform operations while testing the server . This will ensure that the memory backend is created in the server if it does not yet exist , and that it is empty . Note that the base DN for the test backend will always be `` o=test '' , and it must not be changed . It is acceptable for test cases using this backend to hard-code their sample data to use this base DN , although they may still reference the < CODE > TEST_ROOT_DN_STRING < /CODE > constant if they wish .
49866	Starts a new repository without initial import , since this directory was never unmanaged . This will create a nice empty repo that people can push into , as opposed to one they have to pull from . This prevents a user mistake like JENKINS-25632 .
49870	Compares two DynAny values for equality . Two DynAny values are equal if their TypeCodes are equivalent and , recursively , all component DynAnys have equal values . The current position of the two DynAnys being compared has no effect on the result of equal .
49871	Reads the next byte of data from this input stream . The value byte is returned as an < code > int < /code > in the range < code > 0 < /code > to < code > 255 < /code > . If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached , the value < code > -1 < /code > is returned . This method blocks until input data is available , the end of the stream is detected , or an exception is thrown . < p > This method simply performs < code > in.read ( ) < /code > and returns the result .
49883	This method calls < code > dragExit < /code > on the < code > DragSourceListener < /code > s registered with this < code > DragSource < /code > , and passes them the specified < code > DragSourceEvent < /code > .
49889	The Android SSLSocket and SSLServerSocket implementations are based on a version of OpenSSL which includes support for RFC 4507 session tickets . When using session tickets , the server does not need to keep a cache mapping session IDs to SSL sessions for reuse . Instead , the client presents the server with a session ticket it received from the server earlier , which is an SSL session encrypted by the server 's secret key . Since in this case the server does not need to keep a cache , some tests may find different results depending on whether or not the session tickets are in use . These tests can use this function to determine if loopback SSL connections are expected to use session tickets and conditionalize their results appropriately .
49891	Gets the ith element of given table ( if nonnull ) with volatile read semantics . Note : This is manually integrated into a few performance-sensitive methods to reduce call overhead .
49896	Returns whether this job priority attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class JobPriority . < LI > This job priority attribute 's value and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's value are equal . < /OL >
49901	Registers the provided OID as a supported control for the Directory Server . This will have no effect if the specified control OID is already present in the list of supported controls .
49908	Paints this canvas . < p > Most applications that subclass < code > Canvas < /code > should override this method in order to perform some useful operation ( typically , custom painting of the canvas ) . The default operation is simply to clear the canvas . Applications that override this method need not call super.paint ( g ) .
49914	Returns a string version of this two-dimensional size attribute . The string takes the form < CODE > '' < I > X < /I > x < I > Y < /I > um '' < /CODE > , where < I > X < /I > is the X dimension and < I > Y < /I > is the Y dimension . The values are reported in the internal units of micrometers .
49975	Initializes the properties to be used by OpenAM . Ideally this must be called first before any other method is called within OpenAM . This method provides a programmatic way to set the properties , and will override similar properties if loaded for a properties file .
49986	Report an XML comment anywhere in the document . < p > This callback will be used for comments inside or outside the document element , including comments in the external DTD subset ( if read ) . < /p >
49993	These functions support parsing serialized RDF into an XMP object , and serailizing an XMP object into RDF . The input for parsing may be any valid Unicode encoding . ISO Latin-1 is also recognized , but its use is strongly discouraged . Serialization is always as UTF-8 . < p/ > < code > parseFromBuffer ( ) < /code > parses RDF from an < code > InputStream < /code > . The encoding is recognized automatically .
49994	Checks to see if the given variable name is used as an alias , and if so , returns the variable name for which it is used as an alias .
49999	Removes the < code > Condition < /code > object identified by object 's < code > equals < /code > method . If a condition instance does not exist , the method will return silently .
50008	Queries whether any threads have ever contended to acquire this synchronizer ; that is if an acquire method has ever blocked . < p > In this implementation , this operation returns in constant time .
50024	Return the signature algorithm for a possible compound algorithm identifier containing an underscore . If not underscore is present , the argument is returned unmodified . However for an algorithm such as EC_RSA , return RSA .
50025	Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the key property list . < p > For example , `` d : k=v , * '' and `` d : k=* , * '' are key property list patterns whereas `` d : k=* '' is not .
50042	Gives notification from the document that attributes were changed in a location that this view is responsible for . This replaces the ViewFactory with an implementation that calls through to the createTableRow and createTableCell methods . If the element given to the factory is n't a table row or cell , the request is delegated to the factory passed as an argument .
50043	Takes a Position and calculates the location of a destination point given a distance in degrees , radians , miles , or kilometers ; and bearing in degrees . This uses the Haversine formula to account for global curvature .
50049	Returns an alias to authenticate the server side of a secure socket given the public key type and the list of certificate issuer authorities recognized by the peer ( if any ) .
50061	See < code > readObject < /code > and < code > writeObject < /code > in < code > JComponent < /code > for more information about serialization in Swing .
50062	Decodes a < code > x-www-form-urlencoded < /code > string . Except '+ ' is not decoded to a ' ' as described at the top of this class . UTF-8 encoding is used to determine what characters are represented by any consecutive sequences of the form `` < code > % < i > xy < /i > < /code > '' .
50074	Low-level access to decoding ASCII characters in the form of a byte array . < strong > Ignores GUNZIP option , if it 's set. < /strong > This is not generally a recommended method , although it is used internally as part of the decoding process . Special case : if len = 0 , an empty array is returned . Still , if you need more speed and reduced memory footprint ( and are n't gzipping ) , consider this method .
50076	Returns the successor of p , or the head node if p.next has been linked to self , which will only be true if traversing with a stale pointer that is now off the list .
50080	Removes any previous tile grid parameters specified by calls to < code > setTiling < /code > . < p > The default implementation sets the instance variables < code > tileWidth < /code > , < code > tileHeight < /code > , < code > tileGridXOffset < /code > , and < code > tileGridYOffset < /code > to < code > 0 < /code > .
50084	Returns a request that creates a TLS tunnel via an HTTP proxy , or null if no tunnel is necessary . Everything in the tunnel request is sent unencrypted to the proxy server , so tunnels include only the minimum set of headers . This avoids sending potentially sensitive data like HTTP cookies to the proxy unencrypted .
50088	Copy bytes from a < code > File < /code > to an < code > OutputStream < /code > . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > . < /p >
50096	This method pushes an element `` stack frame '' but with no initialization of values in that frame . This method is used for optimization purposes , like when pushing a stack frame for an HTML `` IMG '' tag which has no children and the stack frame will almost immediately be popped .
50102	A static method to retrieve the named object . This is a shortcut method equivalent to invoking : < p > < code > InitialContext ic = new InitialContext ( ) ; Object obj = ic.lookup ( ) ; < /code > < p > If < tt > name < /tt > is empty , returns a new instance of this context ( which represents the same naming context as this context , but its environment may be modified independently and it may be accessed concurrently ) .
50108	Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list . Shifts the element currently at that position ( if any ) and any subsequent elements to the right ( adds one to their indices ) .
50111	Constructs a cookie from a string . The string should comply with set-cookie or set-cookie2 header format as specified in < a href= '' http : //www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt '' > RFC 2965 < /a > . Since set-cookies2 syntax allows more than one cookie definitions in one header , the returned object is a list .
50118	Report a fatal XML parsing error . < p > The default implementation throws a SAXParseException . Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they need to take specific actions for each fatal error ( such as collecting all of the errors into a single report ) : in any case , the application must stop all regular processing when this method is invoked , since the document is no longer reliable , and the parser may no longer report parsing events. < /p >
50127	Writes chars from a < code > char [ ] < /code > to a < code > Writer < /code > using the default character encoding of the platform .
50152	Schedules a repaint for the specified component . This differs from < code > root.repaint < /code > in that if the RepaintManager is currently processing paint requests it 'll process this request with the current set of requests .
50166	Returns whether this job impressions attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class JobImpressions . < LI > This job impressions attribute 's value and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's value are equal . < /OL >
50168	Closes the proxied input stream and , if so configured , the associated output stream . An exception thrown from one stream will not prevent closing of the other stream .
50170	Log a WARNING message , which is only to be constructed if the logging level is such that the message will actually be logged . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the WARNING message level then the message is constructed by invoking the provided supplier function and forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
50173	Retrieves the number of pending operations in the queue that have not yet been picked up for processing . Note that this method is not a constant-time operation and can be relatively inefficient , so it should be used sparingly .
50175	Reads unmarshalled data from < code > input < /code > and assigns it to the < code > value < /code > field in this < code > IntHolder < /code > object .
50178	Returns the number of bytes currently being used to store the values in this cache . This may be greater than the max size if a background deletion is pending .
50193	Returns a < code > JScrollPane.ScrollBar < /code > by default . Subclasses may override this method to force < code > ScrollPaneUI < /code > implementations to use a < code > JScrollBar < /code > subclass . Used by < code > ScrollPaneUI < /code > implementations to create the vertical scrollbar .
50210	Converts the given number to its Greek alphabet lowercase string representation . E.g . 1 will be converted to `` ? `` , 2 to `` ? `` , and so on .
50220	Determines whether a composite name is a suffix of this composite name . A composite name ' n ' is a suffix if it it is equal to getSuffix ( size ( ) -n.size ( ) ) -- in other words , this composite name ends with ' n ' . If n is null or not a composite name , false is returned .
50221	This method is used in foreground processing of a modify DN operation . It uses the specified map to perform base DN searching for each map entry . The key is the old entry DN and the value is the new entry DN .
50227	Invokes supers implementation to uninstall any of its state . This will also reset the < code > LayoutManager < /code > of the < code > JRootPane < /code > . If a < code > Component < /code > has been added to the < code > JRootPane < /code > to render the window decoration style , this method will remove it . Similarly , this will revert the Border and LayoutManager of the < code > JRootPane < /code > to what it was before < code > installUI < /code > was invoked .
50258	Leave a traced zone by the name of metricReference for the specified thread . This puts the timestamp in inactive mode . No more analysis will be done on this thread .
50260	Returns true if the next complete token matches the specified pattern . A complete token is prefixed and postfixed by input that matches the delimiter pattern . This method may block while waiting for input . The scanner does not advance past any input .
50261	Generates the string representation of this exception . The string representation consists of this exception 's class name , its detailed message , and if it has a root cause , the string representation of the root cause exception , followed by the remaining name ( if it is not null ) . This string is used for debugging and not meant to be interpreted programmatically .
50264	Returns the input subsequence matched by the previous match . < p > For a matcher < i > m < /i > with input sequence < i > s < /i > , the expressions < i > m. < /i > < tt > group ( ) < /tt > and < i > s. < /i > < tt > substring ( < /tt > < i > m. < /i > < tt > start ( ) , < /tt > & nbsp ; < i > m. < /i > < tt > end ( ) ) < /tt > are equivalent . < /p > < p > Note that some patterns , for example < tt > a* < /tt > , match the empty string . This method will return the empty string when the pattern successfully matches the empty string in the input . < /p >
50265	Returns an appropriate capacity for the specified initial size . Does not round the result up to a power of two ; the caller must do this ! The returned value will be between 0 and MAXIMUM_CAPACITY ( inclusive ) .
50270	Compares two group identifiers for content equality . Returns true if both of the following conditions are true : 1 ) the unique identifiers are equivalent ( by content ) , and 2 ) the activation system specified in each refers to the same remote object .
50276	Returns < code > true < /code > if the specified < i > x , y < /i > location is contained within the look and feel 's defined shape of the specified component . < code > x < /code > and < code > y < /code > are defined to be relative to the coordinate system of the specified component . Although a component 's < code > bounds < /code > is constrained to a rectangle , this method provides the means for defining a non-rectangular shape within those bounds for the purpose of hit detection .
50278	Consumes all the messages in this queue up to and including the passed in message . If the passed in message is not contained in the current queue , then all messages will be removed from it .
50279	Returns a < code > JScrollPane.ScrollBar < /code > by default . Subclasses may override this method to force < code > ScrollPaneUI < /code > implementations to use a < code > JScrollBar < /code > subclass . Used by < code > ScrollPaneUI < /code > implementations to create the horizontal scrollbar .
50281	Computes a message digest value . < BR > The method resets the engine . < BR > The method overrides `` engineDigest ( ) '' in class MessageDigestSpi . < BR >
50295	Called to notify the client that data has been successfully transferred to the print service , and the client may free local resources allocated for that data . The client should not assume that the data has been completely printed after receiving this event .
50312	Determines whether the current input method is enabled for composition . An input method that is enabled for composition interprets incoming events for both composition and control purposes , while a disabled input method does not interpret events for composition .
50316	Remove an attribute from the list . < p > SAX application writers can use this method to filter an attribute out of an AttributeList . Note that invoking this method will change the length of the attribute list and some of the attribute 's indices. < /p > < p > If the requested attribute is not in the list , this is a no-op. < /p >
50319	This method will be called by < code > dispatchKeyEvent < /code > . It will handle any unconsumed KeyEvents that map to an AWT < code > MenuShortcut < /code > by consuming the event and activating the shortcut .
50324	Adds a Token operation into the monitoring store . < br/ > The operation is not mapped to a particular token type , this is for operations such as delete and list as the type of token can not be determined . The operations per configurable period and cumulative count will be updated for the operation .
50328	Called if a file rotation is detected . This method is called before the file is reopened , and fileNotFound may be called if the new file has not yet been created .
50361	Degrades this connection such that new streams can neither be created locally , nor accepted from the remote peer . Existing streams are not impacted . This is intended to permit an endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new requests without harming previously established streams .
50376	Reloads the pluggable UI . The key used to fetch the new interface is < code > getUIClassID ( ) < /code > . The type of the UI is < code > TextUI < /code > . < code > invalidate < /code > is called after setting the UI .
50393	Returns true if < code > anotherNode < /code > is a descendant of this node -- if it is this node , one of this node 's children , or a descendant of one of this node 's children . Note that a node is considered a descendant of itself . If < code > anotherNode < /code > is null , returns false . This operation is at worst O ( h ) where h is the distance from the root to < code > anotherNode < /code > .
50394	Returns a string representation of this < code > JToolTip < /code > . This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes , and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations . The returned string may be empty but may not be < code > null < /code > .
50396	Indicates if the provided schema file corresponds to the configuration schema . < p > The file containing the definitions of the schema elements used for configuration must not be imported nor propagated to other servers because these definitions may vary between versions of OpenDJ .
50405	Searches for static groups in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of static groups with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
50410	Marshals the value in this < code > IntHolder < /code > object 's < code > value < /code > field to the output stream < code > output < /code > .
50411	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object . It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy ( ) to avoid resource leaks . Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid . Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST . It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained .
50447	Binds a name to an object , overwriting any existing binding . All intermediate contexts and the target context ( that named by all but terminal atomic component of the name ) must already exist . < p > If the object is a DirContext , any existing attributes associated with the name are replaced with those of the object . Otherwise , any existing attributes associated with the name remain unchanged .
50475	Sends the specified range of characters as sax Comment . < p > Note that , unlike sendSAXcharacters , this has to be done as a single call to LexicalHandler # comment .
50477	Add the attributes from the named attribute sets to the attribute list . TODO : Error handling for : `` It is an error if there are two attribute sets with the same expanded-name and with equal import precedence and that both contain the same attribute unless there is a definition of the attribute set with higher import precedence that also contains the attribute . ''

If the 'after ' audit event fails due to an error , the request is not cancelled as it 's affects may have already been applied .
50733	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object . It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy ( ) to avoid resource leaks . Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid . Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST . It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained .
50734	Returns an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map . The set is backed by the map , so changes to the map are reflected in the set , and vice-versa . If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress , the results of the iteration are undefined . The set supports element removal , which removes the corresponding mapping from the map , via the < tt > Iterator.remove < /tt > , < tt > Set.remove < /tt > , < tt > removeAll < /tt > , < tt > retainAll < /tt > , and < tt > clear < /tt > methods . It does not support the < tt > add < /tt > or < tt > addAll < /tt > methods . < p > < b > While the object returned by this method implements the < tt > Set < /tt > interface , it does < i > not < /i > obey < tt > Set 's < /tt > general contract . Like its backing map , the set returned by this method defines element equality as reference-equality rather than object-equality . This affects the behavior of its < tt > contains < /tt > , < tt > remove < /tt > , < tt > containsAll < /tt > , < tt > equals < /tt > , and < tt > hashCode < /tt > methods. < /b > < p > < b > The < tt > equals < /tt > method of the returned set returns < tt > true < /tt > only if the specified object is a set containing exactly the same object references as the returned set . The symmetry and transitivity requirements of the < tt > Object.equals < /tt > contract may be violated if the set returned by this method is compared to a normal set . However , the < tt > Object.equals < /tt > contract is guaranteed to hold among sets returned by this method. < /b > < p > The < tt > hashCode < /tt > method of the returned set returns the sum of the < i > identity hashcodes < /i > of the elements in the set , rather than the sum of their hashcodes . This is mandated by the change in the semantics of the < tt > equals < /tt > method , in order to enforce the general contract of the < tt > Object.hashCode < /tt > method among sets returned by this method .
50741	Merges two properties files into one . The first argument is the original properties file ; the second is the one to prepend ; and the third is the output filename . < p > E.g . < code > key1=x ( from original properties file ) < /code > and < code > key1=y ( from the other properties file ) < /code > will result in < code > key1=x y < /code > .
50752	Meaningful only for SP side , the implementation of this method will create a local session for the local user identified by the information in the map . The underline mechanism of the session creation and management is application specific . For example , it could be cookie setting or url rewriting , which is expected to be done by the implementation of this method . Note that only the first input parameter is mandatory . Normally , at least one of the last two parameters should not be null
50754	Searches for organizations in this organizational unit using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a .

51944	Responsible for handling Icon Elements ; deliberately unimplemented . How to implement this method is an issue of policy . For example , if you 're generating an & lt ; img & gt ; tag , how should you represent the src attribute ( the location of the image ) ? In certain cases it could be a URL , in others it could be read from a stream .
51952	Specifies an LDAP object class which is to be associated with this resource . Multiple object classes may be specified . The object classes are used for determining the type of resource being accessed during all requests other than create .

52031	Go through the list of class loaders but exclude the given class loader , then try to load the requested class . The method will stop as soon as the class is found . If the class is not found the method will throw a < CODE > ClassNotFoundException < /CODE > exception .
52036	Get the distance between this location and another . The value of this method is not cached and uses a costly square-root function , so do not repeatedly call this method to get the location 's magnitude . NaN will be returned if the inner result of the sqrt ( ) function overflows , which will be caused if the distance is too long .
52050	Deregisters the provided OID as a supported feature for the Directory Server . This will have no effect if the specified feature OID is not present in the list of supported features .
52069	Handle onNewIntent ( ) to inform the fragment manager that the state is not saved . If you are handling new intents and may be making changes to the fragment state , you want to be sure to call through to the super-class here first . Otherwise , if your state is saved but the activity is not stopped , you could get an onNewIntent ( ) call which happens before onResume ( ) and trying to perform fragment operations at that point will throw IllegalStateException because the fragment manager thinks the state is still saved .

52313	This is the roughly the equivalent of calling Animator.reverse ( ) , except that it uses the same interpolation curve as animateIn ( ) , rather than mirroring it . Also , like animateIn ( ) , if the animation is currently running in the opposite direction , we reverse direction and animate for a correspondingly shorter duration .
52317	Publish the changes in preferences upward to the parent view . < p > This is reimplemented to stop the superclass behavior if the zone has not yet been loaded . If the zone is unloaded for example , the last seen major span is the best estimate and a calculated span for no children is undesirable .
52320	Initializes the subentry manager for the Directory Server . Note that the subentry manager initialization should be done before any dependent components initialization and before bringing any backends online . Configuration backend is a special case and therefore is exception to this rule .
52321	Retrieves the next attribute in this < code > SQLInputImpl < /code > object as a < code > java.sql.Time < /code > object . < P > This method does not perform type-safe checking to determine if the returned type is the expected type as this responsibility is delegated to the UDT mapping as implemented by a < code > SQLData < /code > implementation .
52327	Removes the < code > Condition < /code > object identified by object 's < code > equals < /code > method . If a condition instance does not exist , the method will return silently .
52345	This method gets called when a bound property is changed on the associated JTextComponent .

52464	This method should be called at the end of a socket option test 's code but before the exception catch statements . It throws a failure if the option given is not supported on the current platform but the VM failed to throw an exception . So , on platforms which do not support the option , the execution should never get to this method .
52474	Receive notification of the end of an element . < p > The SAX parser will invoke this method at the end of every element in the XML document ; there will be a corresponding startElement ( ) event for every endElement ( ) event ( even when the element is empty ) . < /p > < p > If the element name has a namespace prefix , the prefix will still be attached to the name. < /p >
52475	Traditionally , Unix systems have one file per time zone . We have one big data file , which is just a concatenation of regular time zone files . To allow random access into this big data file , we also have an index . We read the index at startup , and keep it in memory so we can binary search by id when we need time zone data . The format of this file is , I believe , Android 's own , and undocumented . All this code assumes strings are US-ASCII .
52490	Reads an 8-bit byte from the current position in this file . Blocks until one byte has been read , the end of the file is reached or an exception is thrown .
52496	Adds a set of a given value to a map . Set will not be added if < code > attrMap < /code > is null or < code > value < /code > is null or < code > key < /code > is null .

52511	Registers a .ttf , .otf , .afm , .pfm , or a .ttc font file . In case if TrueType Collection ( .ttc ) , an additional parameter may be specified defining the index of the font to be registered , e.g . `` path/to/font/collection.ttc,0 '' . The index is zero-based .
52517	Directly call the characters method on the passed ContentHandler for the string-value of the given node ( see http : //www.w3.org/TR/xpath # data-model for the definition of a node 's string-value ) . Multiple calls to the ContentHandler 's characters methods may well occur for a single call to this method .
52521	< p > Prints debug and exception messages only when the debug state is either DEBUG.MESSAGE or Debug.ON . If the debug file is not accessible and debugging is enabled , the message along with a time stamp and thread info will be printed on < code > System.out < /code > . < /p > < p > This method creates the debug file if does not exist ; otherwise it starts appending to the existing debug file . When invoked for the first time on this object , the method writes a line delimiter of '*'s. < /p > < p > Note that the debug file will remain open until < code > destroy ( ) < /code > is invoked . To conserve file resources , you should invoke < code > destroy ( ) < /code > explicitly rather than wait for the garbage collector to clean up. < /p > < p > < b > NOTE : < /b > Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused . Particularly , note that Java evaluates arguments to < code > message ( ) < /code > even when debugging is turned off . It is recommended that the debug state be checked by invoking < code > messageEnabled ( ) < /code > before invoking any < code > message ( ) < /code > methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and to maximize application performance. < /p >
52533	Removes an ingredient from the list . If the ingredient occurs multiple times , only one instance of it is removed . If the data value is -1 , only ingredients with a -1 data value will be removed .

Called by StylesheetRoot.recompose ( ) , after all ElemTemplate compose ( ) operations have taken place , in order to set up handlers for the remaining extension namespaces .
52654	Retrieves records from a log file provided the user has the required authorization . It identifies the filename using < code > logname < /code > and < code > type < /code > . It reads all records from the file but returns the maximum number of most recent records set through configuration .
52678	Reset the values used by the geteffectiverights evaluation to original values . The geteffectiverights evaluation uses the same container repeatedly for different rights evaluations ( read , write , proxy , ... ) and this method resets variables that are specific to a single evaluation .
52680	Initialize the helper framework . This method must be called from the static initializer of each class that is the target of one of the methods in this class . This ensures that the helper is initialized prior to a tunneled call from the Sun provider .
52687	Activates the installed < code > IIOParamController < /code > for this < code > IIOParam < /code > object and returns the resulting value . When this method returns < code > true < /code > , all values for this < code > IIOParam < /code > object will be ready for the next read or write operation . If < code > false < /code > is returned , no settings in this object will have been disturbed ( < i > i.e. < /i > , the user canceled the operation ) . < p > Ordinarily , the controller will be a GUI providing a user interface for a subclass of < code > IIOParam < /code > for a particular plug-in . Controllers need not be GUIs , however .

52785	Determines whether the provided managed object can be used by the server . This method is invoked each time a managed object is decoded by the administration framework : when an attempt is made to add a new configuration , modify an existing configuration , or during server initialization . If the constraint is not satisfied the managed object will be rejected . < p > If the constraint is not satisfied , the implementation must return < code > false < /code > and add a message describing why the managed object is not usable . < p > The default implementation is to return < code > true < /code > .
52787	Translation-time validation of the attributes . Request-time attributes are indicated as such in the TagData parameter . Because of the higher quality validation messages possible , this is the preferred way to do validation ( although isValid ( ) still works ) . < p > JSP 2.0 and higher containers call validate ( ) instead of isValid ( ) . The default implementation of this method is to call isValid ( ) . If isValid ( ) returns false , a generic ValidationMessage [ ] is returned indicating isValid ( ) returned false. < /p >
52794	This method tries to extract an ASF-header out of the given stream , which only contains metadata. < br > If no header could be extracted < code > null < /code > is returned . < br >

52852	Makes a best-effort attempt to apply the configuration contained in the provided entry . Information about the result of this processing should be added to the provided message list . Information should always be added to this list if a configuration change could not be applied . If detailed results are requested , then information about the changes applied successfully ( and optionally about parameters that were not changed ) should also be included .
52854	This is no longer used , instead & lt ; span & gt ; will be written out . < p > Writes out an end tag for the & lt ; font & gt ; tag .
52870	Dispatches the given JSP parse error to the configured error handler . The given error code is localized . If it is not found in the resource bundle for localized error messages , it is used as the error message .

52888	Called when a fragment is attached as a child of this fragment . < p > This is called after the attached fragment 's < code > onAttach < /code > and before the attached fragment 's < code > onCreate < /code > if the fragment has not yet had a previous call to < code > onCreate < /code > . < /p >
52897	Returns the TypeCode associated with this DynAny object . A DynAny object is created with a TypeCode value assigned to it . This TypeCode value determines the type of the value handled through the DynAny object . Note that the TypeCode associated with a DynAny object is initialized at the time the DynAny is created and can not be changed during lifetime of the DynAny object .
52898	Finds the implementation < code > Class < /code > object for the given factory name , or null if that fails . < P > This method is package private so that this code can be shared .
52899	Pop the top object off of the stack , and return it . If there are no objects on the stack , return < code > null < /code > .
52901	Check if there are any listeners for a specific property , including those registered on all properties . If < code > propertyName < /code > is null , only check for listeners registered on all properties .
52916	Build authentication mechanism that will keep the session alive via the use of session token . The mechanism will never log out , but the session may expire if not refresh regularly . This is potentially unsafe , as it will eventually store a plain-text access token on the hard drive , for everyone to see . The token will only be refreshed if RoboZonky is launched between token expiration and X second before token expiration , where X comes from the arguments of this method .
52943	Given a stylesheet element , create a result tree fragment from it 's contents . The fragment will be built within the shared RTF DTM system used as a variable stack .
52961	Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method to take specific actions for each chunk of ignorable whitespace ( such as adding data to a node or buffer , or printing it to a file ) . < /p >

53032	Compares the specified Object with this < code > SMPrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns < code > true < /code > if the given object is also a < code > SMPrincipal < /code > and the two < code > SMPrincipal < /code > s have the same user name .
53034	Imports the specified parameters and decodes them according to the primary decoding format for parameters . The primary decoding format for parameters is ASN.1 , if an ASN.1 specification for this type of parameters exists .
53036	This method is for compatibility . Tests written to the reference implementation API imply that the isLoggable ( ) method is not called directly . This behavior is important because subclass may override isLoggable ( ) method , so that affect the result of log methods .
53050	Removes the < code > Subject < /code > object identified by object 's < code > equals < /code > method . If a Subject instance does not exist , the method will return silently .
53055	Inserts a component into the document as a replacement for the currently selected content . If there is no selection the component is effectively inserted at the current position of the caret . This is represented in the associated document as an attribute of one character of content . < p > The component given is the actual component used by the JTextPane . Since components can not be a child of more than one container , this method should not be used in situations where the model is shared by text components . < p > The component is placed relative to the text baseline according to the value returned by < code > Component.getAlignmentY < /code > . For Swing components this value can be conveniently set using the method < code > JComponent.setAlignmentY < /code > . For example , setting a value of < code > 0.75 < /code > will cause 75 percent of the component to be above the baseline , and 25 percent of the component to be below the baseline .
53059	Copy chars from a < code > Reader < /code > to a < code > Writer < /code > . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > . < p > Large streams ( over 2GB ) will return a chars copied value of < code > -1 < /code > after the copy has completed since the correct number of chars can not be returned as an int . For large streams use the < code > copyLarge ( Reader , Writer ) < /code > method .
53076	Advances the current position to the next component . The operation returns true while the resulting current position indicates a component , false otherwise . A false return value leaves the current position at -1 . Invoking next on a DynAny without components leaves the current position at -1 and returns false .
53077	Transforms the application result such that its resource types are removed and a single set of actions and resources are represented instead . The set of actions and resources are a union of their respective parts from the associated resource types .
53079	Receive notification of a skipped entity . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each processing instruction , such as setting status variables or invoking other methods. < /p >
53085	Determines whether a compound name is a prefix of this compound name . A compound name ' n ' is a prefix if it is equal to getPrefix ( n.size ( ) ) -- in other words , this compound name starts with ' n ' . If n is null or not a compound name , false is returned . < p > Implementation note : Currently the syntax properties of n are not used when doing the comparison . They might be in the future .
53088	Records an 'access ' audit event before and after the filtered CREST resource receives an delete request . If the 'before ' audit event fails due to an error , the request is cancelled and an error response is returned . If the 'after ' audit event fails due to an error , the request is not cancelled as it 's affects may have already been applied .
53095	Searches for group containers in this group container using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of group containers with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
53099	This method returns a < code > boolean < /code > indicating if the specified < code > DataFlavor < /code > is available from the source . < P >
53100	Returns the `` searchScope '' string argument. < br > < i > N.B : the 's ' short option is also used by servicestate , sourceldif , randomSeed , script-friendly. < /i >
53101	Compares two strings lexicographically , ignoring case considerations . This method returns an integer whose sign is that of < code > this.toUpperCase ( ) .toLowerCase ( ) .compareTo ( str.toUpperCase ( ) .toLowerCase ( ) ) < /code > . < p > Note that this method does < em > not < /em > take locale into account , and will result in an unsatisfactory ordering for certain locales . The java.text package provides < em > collators < /em > to allow locale-sensitive ordering .
53108	Invoked this to insert newChild at location index in parents children . This will then message nodesWereInserted to create the appropriate event . This is the preferred way to add children as it will create the appropriate event .
53122	Visits the end of the class . This method , which is the last one to be called , is used to inform the visitor that all the fields and methods of the class have been visited .
53123	Register a font file , either .ttf or .otf , .afm or a font from TrueType Collection . If a TrueType Collection is registered , an additional index of the font program can be specified

To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class DateTimeSyntax . < LI > This date-time attribute 's < code > java.util.Date < /code > value and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's < code > java.util.Date < /code > value are equal . < /OL >
53142	Checks if the specified year is a leap year . < p > Japanese calendar leap years occur exactly in line with ISO leap years . This method does not validate the year passed in , and only has a well-defined result for years in the supported range .
53145	Computes an identity hash code and applies a supplemental hash function to defend against poor quality hash functions . This is critical because identity hash codes are currently implemented as object addresses , which will have been aligned by the underlying memory allocator causing all hash codes to have the same bottom bits .
53147	Receive notification of a parser warning . < p > The default implementation does nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each warning , such as inserting the message in a log file or printing it to the console. < /p >
53153	Returns true if edits may be undone . If < code > end < /code > has been invoked , this returns the value from super . Otherwise this returns true if there are any edits to be undone ( < code > editToBeUndone < /code > returns non- < code > null < /code > ) .
53176	Returns a new string that is a substring of this string . The substring begins at the specified < code > beginIndex < /code > and extends to the character at index < code > endIndex - 1 < /code > . Thus the length of the substring is < code > endIndex-beginIndex < /code > .
53178	Clear the attribute list . < p > SAX parser writers can use this method to reset the attribute list between DocumentHandler.startElement events . Normally , it will make sense to reuse the same AttributeListImpl object rather than allocating a new one each time. < /p >
53185	Adds the given attribute to the set of collected attributes , but only if there is a currently open element . An element is currently open if a startElement ( ) notification has occured but the start of the element has not yet been written to the output . In the stream case this means that we have not yet been forced to close the elements opening tag by another notification , such as a character notification .
53186	Initialize the AMIdentitySubject object by using the configuration information passed by the Policy Framework . < p > This implementation not need anything out of the < code > configParams I/code > so does no operation .
53190	Updates this canvas . < p > This method is called in response to a call to < code > repaint < /code > . The canvas is first cleared by filling it with the background color , and then completely redrawn by calling this canvas 's < code > paint < /code > method . Note : applications that override this method should either call super.update ( g ) or incorporate the functionality described above into their own code .
53193	Returns whether this job impressions completed attribute is equivalent tp the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class JobImpressionsCompleted . < LI > This job impressions completed attribute 's value and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's value are equal . < /OL >
53215	Adds the specified region to the dirty region list if the component is showing . The component will be repainted after all of the currently pending events have been dispatched .

53238	Sets the generator that will be used to create or load the world . < p > This may be null , in which case the `` natural '' generator for this environment will be used . < p > If the generator can not be found for the given name , the natural environment generator will be used instead and a warning will be printed to the console .
53255	Receive notification of a notation declaration . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they wish to keep track of the notations declared in a document. < /p >
53256	Paints the foreground of an arrow button . This method is responsible for drawing a graphical representation of a direction , typically an arrow . Arrow buttons are created by some components , such as < code > JScrollBar < /code >
53270	In the standard coroutine architecture , coroutines are identified by their method names and are launched and run up to their first yield by simply resuming them ; its 's presumed that this recognizes the not-already-running case and does the right thing . We seem to need a way to achieve that same threadsafe run-up ... eg , start the coroutine with a wait . % TBD % whether this makes any sense ...
53281	Provide default configuration for a context . This is the programmatic equivalent of the default web.xml . TODO : in normal Tomcat , if default-web.xml is not found , use this method
53303	Returns the location of < code > index < /code > in terms of the model prior to the sort . This method is only useful for events of type < code > SORTED < /code > . This method will return -1 if the index is not valid , or the locations prior to the sort have not been provided .
53306	Figure out whether nodeHandle2 should be considered as being later in the document than nodeHandle1 , in Document Order as defined by the XPath model . This may not agree with the ordering defined by other XML applications . < p > There are some cases where ordering is n't defined , and neither are the results of this function -- though we 'll generally return true . TODO : Make sure this does the right thing with attribute nodes ! ! !
53308	Creates a < code > FocusListener < /code > which will be added to the combo box . If this method returns null then it will not be added to the combo box .
53311	Receive notification of a notation declaration . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they wish to keep track of the notations declared in a document. < /p >
53315	Obtains a fixed value range . < p > This factory obtains a range where the minimum and maximum values are fixed . For example , the ISO month-of-year always runs from 1 to 12 .
53324	This function is called after everything else has been recomposed , and allows the template to set remaining values that may be based on some other property that depends on recomposition .
53326	Indicates whether this pool is unused . A pool is unused if there is neither an entry nor a waiting thread . All entries count , not only the free but also the allocated ones .
53334	Sets a custom implementation of the org.forgerock.openam.sts.tokengeneration.oidc.OpenIdConnectTokenClaimMapper interface , which will be referenced when performing the claim mapping for custom claims to be included in issued OIDC tokens .

53343	Terminates this timer , discarding any currently scheduled tasks . Does not interfere with a currently executing task ( if it exists ) . Once a timer has been terminated , its execution thread terminates gracefully , and no more tasks may be scheduled on it . < p > Note that calling this method from within the run method of a timer task that was invoked by this timer absolutely guarantees that the ongoing task execution is the last task execution that will ever be performed by this timer . < p > This method may be called repeatedly ; the second and subsequent calls have no effect .
53351	Sets the current position to index . The current position is indexed 0 to n-1 , that is , index zero corresponds to the first component . The operation returns true if the resulting current position indicates a component of the DynAny and false if index indicates a position that does not correspond to a component . Calling seek with a negative index is legal . It sets the current position to -1 to indicate no component and returns false . Passing a non-negative index value for a DynAny that does not have a component at the corresponding position sets the current position to -1 and returns false .
53362	Deregisters the provided OID as a supported control for the Directory Server . This will have no effect if the specified control OID is not present in the list of supported controls .
53363	Returns the next character on the input . < p > < strong > Note : < /strong > The character is < em > not < /em > consumed .
53367	WriteObject is called to save this filename . The separator character is saved also so it can be replaced in case the path is reconstituted on a different host type . < p >
53371	Resolve an external entity . < p > Always return null , so that the parser will use the system identifier provided in the XML document . This method implements the SAX default behaviour : application writers can override it in a subclass to do special translations such as catalog lookups or URI redirection. < /p >
53397	Checks to see if the size of the file is favorable . < p > If size equals threshold and smaller files are required , file < b > IS NOT < /b > selected . If size equals threshold and larger files are required , file < b > IS < /b > selected .

53406	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a String using the specified character encoding . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > . < /p >
53411	Returns the index of the given instruction in this list . This method builds a cache of the instruction indexes to avoid scanning the whole list each time it is called . Once the cache is built , this method run in constant time . The cache is invalidated by all the methods that modify the list .
53415	Adds a binding for < code > keyStroke < /code > to < code > actionMapKey < /code > . If < code > actionMapKey < /code > is null , this removes the current binding for < code > keyStroke < /code > .
53440	Creates and returns an enumeration that traverses the subtree rooted at this node in breadth-first order . The first node returned by the enumeration 's < code > nextElement ( ) < /code > method is this node. < P > Modifying the tree by inserting , removing , or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification .
53444	The function returns Signum.POSITIVE , if the scalar product of of a vector representing this direction and a vector representing p_other is > 0 , Signum.NEGATIVE , if the scalar product is < 0 , and Signum.ZERO , if the scalar product is equal 0 .
53447	Notifies this component that it no longer has a parent component . When this method is invoked , any < code > KeyboardAction < /code > s set up in the the chain of parent components are removed . This method is called by the toolkit internally and should not be called directly by programs .
53457	< p > Are error messages currently enabled ? < /p > < p > This allows expensive operations such as < code > String < /code > concatenation to be avoided when the message will be ignored by the logger . < /p >
53458	Gets the status of local echo for this conversation . If local echo is enabled , any text submitted to a conversation gets echoed back into the submitter 's chat window .
53475	Use an XPath string to select a single node . XPath namespace prefixes are resolved from the context node , which may not be what you want ( see the next method ) .
53478	Adds the specified selected item in the object to the object 's selection . If the object supports multiple selections , the specified item is added to any existing selection , otherwise it replaces any existing selection in the object . If the specified item is already selected , this method has no effect .
53492	Advances the current position to the next component . The operation returns true while the resulting current position indicates a component , false otherwise . A false return value leaves the current position at -1 . Invoking next on a DynAny without components leaves the current position at -1 and returns false .
53501	Appends the Query String name/value pairs ( NVP ) that have been supplied via the JSP tag attribute `` queryParams '' . NOTE - this tag assumes that the JSP author has URL encoded the value portions of the name value pairs where needed . This tag also prepends an ampersand ' & ' before the first NVP , and assumes that the JSP author has provided the ' & ' delimiters between the remaining NVPs .
53505	Returns the TypeCode associated with this DynAny object . A DynAny object is created with a TypeCode value assigned to it . This TypeCode value determines the type of the value handled through the DynAny object . Note that the TypeCode associated with a DynAny object is initialized at the time the DynAny is created and can not be changed during lifetime of the DynAny object .
53513	Sends SEND_SUCCESS automatically . As we 're on our way out of the system at this point , there 's no need to hold them up , or append anything new to the response .
53529	Compares this string to the specified object . The result is < code > true < /code > if and only if the argument is not < code > null < /code > and is a < code > String < /code > object that represents the same sequence of characters as this object .
53532	Removes the first occurrence , starting at the beginning and moving towards the end , of the specified object from this vector . All elements with an index bigger than the element that gets removed have their index decreased by 1 .

If not set , the org.forgerock.openam.sts.rest.token.provider.oidc.DefaultOpenIdConnectTokenAuthnContextMapper will be used , which simply returns null .
53583	Reads a big-endian 64-bit double from the current position in this file . Blocks until eight bytes have been read , the end of the file is reached or an exception is thrown .
53586	Generates a random name for use in some policy elements . Note on using Random instead of SecureRandom in generating random name : names generated in this method are used for policy elements Conditions , Referrals , Subjects , Rule and Subjects if a name is not supplied by the caller . Random is used to come up with a name that is not likely to be used in the same policy . These names are not meant to be secrets . So , not a security problem .
53588	Returns < tt > true < /tt > if and only if this < tt > TabularData < /tt > instance contains a < tt > CompositeData < /tt > value ( ie a row ) whose index is the specified < var > key < /var > . If < var > key < /var > is < tt > null < /tt > or does not conform to this < tt > TabularData < /tt > instance 's < tt > TabularType < /tt > definition , this method simply returns < tt > false < /tt > .
53608	Returns previous node , or throws NullPointerException if null . Use when predecessor can not be null . The null check could be elided , but is present to help the VM .
53609	Generates a valid ASCII property list which has this NSArray as its root object . The generated property list complies with the format as described in < a href= '' https : //developer.apple.com/library/mac/ # documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PropertyLists/OldStylePlists/OldStylePLists.html '' > Property List Programming Guide - Old-Style ASCII Property Lists < /a > .
53618	< p > Returns a new < code > BufferedImage < /code > using the same color model as the image passed as a parameter . The returned image is only compatible with the image passed as a parameter . This does not mean the returned image is compatible with the hardware. < /p >

53765	Checks if message debugging is enabled . < p > < b > NOTE : < /b > Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused . Particularly , note that Java evaluates arguments to < code > message ( ) < /code > even when debugging is turned off . It is recommended that < code > messageEnabled ( ) < /code > be called to check the debug state before invoking any < code > message ( ) < /code > methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and maximize application performance. < /p >
53771	Constructs a cookie with a specified name and value and sets a path for the cookie to which the client should return the cookie and sets the domain within which this cookie should be presented .
53773	Add a PropertyChangeListener for a specific property . The listener will be invoked only when a call on firePropertyChange names that specific property . The same listener object may be added more than once . For each property , the listener will be invoked the number of times it was added for that property . If < code > propertyName < /code > or < code > listener < /code > is null , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .

53991	Searches for group containers in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of group containers with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
53993	Returns the arc tangent of a value ; the returned angle is in the range - < i > pi < /i > /2 through < i > pi < /i > /2 . Special cases : < ul > < li > If the argument is NaN , then the result is NaN . < li > If the argument is zero , then the result is a zero with the same sign as the argument. < /ul > < p > The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result . Results must be semi-monotonic .
54013	Indicates whether it is possible for a write operation on the designated column to succeed . A return value of < code > true < /code > means that a write operation may or may not succeed .
54015	Compares only the < code > mimeType < /code > against the passed in < code > String < /code > and < code > representationClass < /code > is not considered in the comparison . If < code > representationClass < /code > needs to be compared , then < code > equals ( new DataFlavor ( s ) ) < /code > may be used .

54037	Compares the specified Object with this < code > MembershipPrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns true if the given object is also a < code > MembershipPrincipal < /code > and the two < code > MembershipPrincipals < /code > have the same user name .
54044	Causes a flush on the target < tt > Handler < /tt > . < p > Note that the current contents of the < tt > MemoryHandler < /tt > buffer are < b > not < /b > written out . That requires a `` push '' .
54047	Returns whether calls to < code > add < /code > and < code > setLayout < /code > are forwarded to the < code > contentPane < /code > .
54053	Translates a string into < code > x-www-form-urlencoded < /code > format with some differences as described at the top of this class . This method uses UTF-8 as the encoding scheme to obtain the bytes for unsafe characters .
54055	Gets the value whether the player would be allowed to build here . Defaults to spawn if the server was going to stop them ( such as , the player is in Spawn ) . Note that this is an entirely different check than BLOCK_CANBUILD , as this refers to a player , not universe-physics rule like cactus on dirt .
54056	Makes this internal frame invisible , unselected , and closed . If the frame is not already closed , this method fires an < code > INTERNAL_FRAME_CLOSED < /code > event . The results of invoking this method are similar to < code > setClosed ( true ) < /code > , but < code > dispose < /code > always succeeds in closing the internal frame and does not fire an < code > INTERNAL_FRAME_CLOSING < /code > event .
54063	Encodes up to the first three bytes of array < var > threeBytes < /var > and returns a four-byte array in Base64 notation . The actual number of significant bytes in your array is given by < var > numSigBytes < /var > . The array < var > threeBytes < /var > needs only be as big as < var > numSigBytes < /var > . Code can reuse a byte array by passing a four-byte array as < var > b4 < /var > .
54066	Overridden to return true so that any calls to < code > revalidate < /code > on any descendants of this < code > JScrollPane < /code > will cause the entire tree beginning with this < code > JScrollPane < /code > to be validated .
54071	Returns < code > isEditable < /code > . This is invoked from the UI before editing begins to insure that the given path can be edited . This is provided as an entry point for subclassers to add filtered editing without having to resort to creating a new editor .
54078	Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method to take specific actions for each chunk of ignorable whitespace ( such as adding data to a node or buffer , or printing it to a file ) . < /p >
54079	Enables the default center tracker . This tracker is always visible and turns green when a barcode is found.\n Please note that you can still scan a barcode outside the center tracker ! This is purely a visual change .
54101	Copies page to the specified document . < br/ > < br/ > NOTE : Works only for pages from the document opened in reading mode , otherwise an exception is thrown .
54121	Indicates whether the nature of this exception allows the caller to continue reading LDIF data . If this method returns < CODE > false < /CODE > , then the associated reader should be closed by the caller .
54122	Returns a modifiable list of interceptors that observe the full span of each call : from before the connection is established ( if any ) until after the response source is selected ( either the origin server , cache , or both ) .
54147	< p > Returns true if the end of input was hit by the search engine in the last match operation performed by this matcher . < p > When this method returns true , then it is possible that more input would have changed the result of the last search .
54151	Writes to the stream the data contained in the given < code > SQLData < /code > object . When the < code > SQLData < /code > object is < code > null < /code > , this method writes an SQL < code > NULL < /code > to the stream . Otherwise , it calls the < code > SQLData.writeSQL < /code > method of the given object , which writes the object 's attributes to the stream . < P > The implementation of the method < code > SQLData.writeSQ < /code > calls the appropriate < code > SQLOutputImpl.writeXXX < /code > method ( s ) for writing each of the object 's attributes in order . The attributes must be read from an < code > SQLInput < /code > input stream and written to an < code > SQLOutputImpl < /code > output stream in the same order in which they were listed in the SQL definition of the user-defined type .
54170	Detach view from its component . Components , which have difference between getView and getRealView or have temp calculation results , must < strong > override < /strong > this method with their own implementation .
54173	Registers a Do handler that will be called when Do for the provided XObject subtype is encountered during content processing . < br > If you register a handler , it is a very good idea to pass the call on to the existing registered handler ( returned by this call ) , otherwise you may inadvertently change the internal behavior of the processor .
54176	Receive notification of the beginning of a document . This method is never a self generated call , but only called externally . < p > The SAX parser will invoke this method only once , before any other methods in this interface or in DTDHandler ( except for setDocumentLocator ) . < /p >
54177	Receive notification of a processing instruction . < p > The Parser will invoke this method once for each processing instruction found : note that processing instructions may occur before or after the main document element. < /p > < p > A SAX parser should never report an XML declaration ( XML 1.0 , section 2.8 ) or a text declaration ( XML 1.0 , section 4.3.1 ) using this method. < /p >
54180	The < code > JViewport < /code > overrides the default implementation of this method ( in < code > JComponent < /code > ) to return false . This ensures that the drawing machinery will call the < code > Viewport < /code > 's < code > paint < /code > implementation rather than messaging the < code > JViewport < /code > 's children directly .
54183	Closing a < tt > ByteArrayInputStream < /tt > has no effect . The methods in this class can be called after the stream has been closed without generating an < tt > IOException < /tt > .
54192	Returns an iterator over the elements in this queue in proper sequence . The elements will be returned in order from first ( head ) to last ( tail ) . < p > The returned iterator is < a href= '' package-summary.html # Weakly '' > < i > weakly consistent < /i > < /a > .
54193	Replaces the currently selected content with new content represented by the given string . If there is no selection this amounts to an insert of the given text . If there is no replacement text this amounts to a removal of the current selection . The replacement text will have the attributes currently defined for input at the point of insertion . If the document is not editable , beep and return .
54202	Returns the character at position < tt > pos < /tt > from the matched text . It is equivalent to yytext ( ) .charAt ( pos ) , but faster
54211	Creates a new FreeSpaceExpansionRoom and adds it to the room list . Its shape is normally unbounded at construction time of the room . The final ( completed ) shape will be a subshape of the start shape , which does not overlap with any obstacle , and it is as big as possible . p_contained_points will remain contained in the shape , after it is completed .
54216	Composes the name of this context with a name relative to this context . < p > Given a name ( name ) relative to this context , and the name ( prefix ) of this context relative to one of its ancestors , this method returns the composition of the two names using the syntax appropriate for the naming system ( s ) involved . That is , if name names an object relative to this context , the result is the name of the same object , but relative to the ancestor context . None of the names may be null .
54217	Decrements the iterator 's index by one and returns the character at the new index . If the current index is getBeginIndex ( ) , the index remains at getBeginIndex ( ) and a value of DONE is returned .
54221	Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present . More formally , adds the specified element < tt > e < /tt > to this set if this set contains no element < tt > e2 < /tt > such that < tt > ( e==null & nbsp ; ? & nbsp ; e2==null & nbsp ; : & nbsp ; e.equals ( e2 ) ) < /tt > . If this set already contains the element , the call leaves the set unchanged and returns < tt > false < /tt > .
54224	Returns whether this printer location attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class PrinterLocation . < LI > This printer location attribute 's underlying string and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's underlying string are equal . < LI > This printer location attribute 's locale and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's locale are equal . < /OL >
54227	Notification from the < code > UIManager < /code > that the look and feel ( L & amp ; F ) has changed . Replaces the current UI object with the latest version from the < code > UIManager < /code > .
54233	Applies the interpolator and length to the animator , such that the fling animation is consistent with the finger motion for the case when the animation is making something disappear .
54247	True if the old return type can always be viewed ( w/o casting ) under new return type , and the new parameters can be viewed ( w/o casting ) under the old parameter types .
54255	Make this LF directly executable , as part of a MethodHandle . Invariant : Every MH which is invoked must prepare its LF before invocation . ( In principle , the JVM could do this very lazily , as a sort of pre-invocation linkage step . )
54256	Private visibility , as this method will only be called when marshalling from Json . The bottom line is that supporting custom token types via the TokenTypeId interface does not allow for the re-constitution of a TokenTypeId instance given a string identifier , as works for Enum instances .
54258	Returns an iterator object that lets you iterate over all elements of the set . This is the equivalent to < code > objectEnumerator < /code > in the Cocoa implementation of NSSet .
54259	Defines if the encryption of the original document ( if it was encrypted ) will be preserved . By default , the resultant document does n't preserve the original encryption .
54261	Creates a new simple bind request having the provided name and password suitable for name/password authentication . The name will be decoded using the default schema . < p > The LDAP protocol defines the Bind name to be a distinguished name , however some LDAP implementations have relaxed this constraint and allow other identities to be used , such as the user 's email address .
54265	Generates the string representation of this name/class pair . The string representation consists of the name and class name separated by a colon ( ' : ' ) . The contents of this string is useful for debugging and is not meant to be interpreted programmatically .
54266	Log a WARNING message . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the WARNING message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
54285	Atomically updates the current value with the results of applying the given function , returning the updated value . The function should be side-effect-free , since it may be re-applied when attempted updates fail due to contention among threads .
54290	Checks if the specified offset is valid during this transition . < p > This checks to see if the given offset will be valid at some point in the transition . A gap will always return false . An overlap will return true if the offset is either the before or after offset .
54296	Choose an alias to authenticate the server side of a secure socket given the public key type and the list of certificate issuer authorities recognized by the peer ( if any ) .
54315	Requests that a given ImageConsumer have the image data delivered one more time in top-down , left-right order . The request is handed to the ImageFilter for further processing , since the ability to preserve the pixel ordering depends on the filter . < p > This method is public as a side effect of this class implementing the < code > ImageProducer < /code > interface . It should not be called from user code , and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified .
54316	Adds the given SmapStratum object , representing a Stratum with logically associated FileSection and LineSection blocks , to the current SmapGenerator . If < tt > default < /tt > is true , this stratum is made the default stratum , overriding any previously set default .
54322	Returns true only if the initial replicas known from the changelog state DB are either : < ul > < li > offline , so do not wait for them in order to compute medium consistency < /li > < li > alive , because we received heartbeats or changes ( so their last alive CSN has been updated to something past the oldest possible CSN ) , we have enough info to compute medium consistency < /li > < /ul > In both cases , we have enough information to compute medium consistency without waiting any further .
54327	Calls < code > dragOver < /code > on the registered < code > DropTargetListener < /code > and passes it the specified < code > DropTargetDragEvent < /code > . Has no effect if this < code > DropTarget < /code > is not active .
54330	Throws an < code > org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT < /code > exception with the message `` This is a locally constrained object . '' This method is the default implementation of the < code > org.omg.CORBA.Object < /code > method. < P >
54335	As warming up TextLayoutCache done in the DOM thread may manipulate UI operation , there may be some exception , in which case the exception is ignored . After all , this is just a warm up operation .
54337	Computes a hash code and applies a supplemental hash function to defend against poor quality hash functions . This is critical because HashMap uses power-of-two length hash tables , that otherwise encounter collisions for hash codes that do not differ in lower or upper bits . Routine taken from java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.hash ( int ) .
54344	Authenticates the administrator . Dervived classes needs to call this method from the dervived method , < code > handleRequest ( RequestContext rc ) < /code > . Override this method to get user name and passowrd .
54352	Returns < tt > true < /tt > if this set contains the specified element . More formally , returns < tt > true < /tt > if and only if this set contains an element < tt > e < /tt > such that < tt > ( o==null & nbsp ; ? & nbsp ; e==null & nbsp ; : & nbsp ; o.equals ( e ) ) < /tt > .
54374	Removes the first occurrence , starting at the beginning and moving towards the end , of the specified object from this vector . All elements with an index bigger than the element that gets removed have their index decreased by 1 .
54385	Update the accessed time information for this session . This method should be called by the context when a request comes in for a particular session , even if the application does not reference it .
54388	This method will be invoked when a service 's global configuration data has been changed . The parameter < code > groupName < /code > denote the name of the configuration grouping ( e.g . default ) and < code > serviceComponent < /code > denotes the service 's sub-component that changed ( e.g . < code > /NamedPolicy < /code > , < code > /Templates < /code > ) .
54403	Remove a PropertyChangeListener from the listener list . This removes a PropertyChangeListener that was registered for all properties . If < code > listener < /code > was added more than once to the same event source , it will be notified one less time after being removed . If < code > listener < /code > is null , or was never added , no exception is thrown and no action is taken .
54412	Returns the number of remaining bytes that can be read ( or skipped over ) from this input stream . < p > The value returned is < code > count & nbsp ; - pos < /code > , which is the number of bytes remaining to be read from the input buffer .
54419	Generates a valid ASCII property list in GnuStep format which has this NSArray as its root object . The generated property list complies with the format as described in < a href= '' http : //www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/Developer/Base/Reference/NSPropertyList.html '' > GnuStep - NSPropertyListSerialization class documentation < /a >
54420	Adds a new value to this attribute . < p > By default , < tt > Object.equals ( ) < /tt > is used when comparing < tt > attrVal < /tt > with this attribute 's values except when < tt > attrVal < /tt > is an array . For an array , each element of the array is checked using < tt > Object.equals ( ) < /tt > . A subclass may use schema information to determine equality .
54421	Removes the specified < code > DragSourceListener < /code > from this < code > DragSource < /code > . If a < code > null < /code > listener is specified , no action is taken and no exception is thrown . If the listener specified by the argument was not previously added to this < code > DragSource < /code > , no action is taken and no exception is thrown .
54424	Indicates whether the backup process should digitally sign the hash of the data when it is archived . Signing the hash offers a means of protection against tampering by an unauthorized party . Note that this option is only applicable if the backup is to include a hash of the archived data .
54426	Returns true if the next token in this scanner 's input can be interpreted as a boolean value using a case insensitive pattern created from the string `` true|false '' . The scanner does not advance past the input that matched .
54433	Associates a particular token type with authIndexType and authIndexValue values . For the associated STS instance , the particular token type will be authenticated against the Rest authN context specified by the authIndexType and authIndexValue .
54438	Returns a properly configured < code > PropertyChangeListener < /code > which updates the control as changes to the < code > Action < /code > occur , or < code > null < /code > if the default property change listener for the control is desired .
54463	Decrements the iterator 's index by one and returns the character at the new index . If the current index is getBeginIndex ( ) , the index remains at getBeginIndex ( ) and a value of DONE is returned .
54472	Pushes back a byte by copying it to the front of the pushback buffer . After this method returns , the next byte to be read will have the value < code > ( byte ) b < /code > .
54477	Creates a new simple bind request having the provided name and password suitable for name/password authentication . The name will be decoded using the default schema . < p > The LDAP protocol defines the Bind name to be a distinguished name , however some LDAP implementations have relaxed this constraint and allow other identities to be used , such as the user 's email address .
54479	Closes this writer . This implementation flushes the buffer as well as the target stream . The target stream is then closed and the resources for the buffer and converter are released . < p > Only the first invocation of this method has any effect . Subsequent calls do nothing .
54483	This method is called on the outbound client side , secure-request in JASPI terms . In the OpenAMSessionTokenClientInterceptor , this method will add the OpenAMSessionAssertion state to the message , but in the server-side interceptor , this method should never be called .
54493	If true , the combo box shall include an editable text box as well as a drop-down list ; if false , it shall include only a drop-down list . This flag shall be used only if the Combo flag is true .
54515	Returns the number of attributes in this attribute set . If this attribute set contains more than < tt > Integer.MAX_VALUE < /tt > elements , returns < tt > Integer.MAX_VALUE < /tt > .
54516	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue . The returned array elements are in no particular order . < p > The returned array will be `` safe '' in that no references to it are maintained by this queue . ( In other words , this method must allocate a new array ) . The caller is thus free to modify the returned array . < p > This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs .
54518	Compares this object with the specified object for order . Returns a negative integer , zero , or a positive integer as this object is less than , equal to , or greater than the specified object. < p > < p/ >
54534	Indicates whether this parser will allow unnamed trailing arguments . These will be arguments at the end of the list that are not preceded by either a long or short identifier and will need to be manually parsed by the application using this parser . Note that once an unnamed trailing argument has been identified , all remaining arguments will be classified as such .
54547	Searches for people containers in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of people containers with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .

54558	This method checks given string will not exceed limit in bytes [ ] when converted UTF-16LE encoding ( 2 bytes per character ) and checks whether the length does n't exceed 65535 bytes . < br >
54569	Performs the necessary internal configurations and initializations to allow any JDBC < code > RowSet < /code > implementation to start using the standard facilities provided by a < code > BaseRowSet < /code > instance . This method < b > should < /b > be called after the < code > RowSet < /code > object has been instantiated to correctly initialize all parameters . This method < b > should < /b > never be called by an application , but is called from with a < code > RowSet < /code > implementation extending this class .
54571	Calculate the requirements needed along the major axis . This is called by the superclass whenever the requirements need to be updated ( i.e . a preferenceChanged was messaged through this view ) . < p > This is implemented to delegate to the superclass , but indicate the maximum size is very large ( i.e . the cell is willing to expend to occupy the full height of the row ) .
54592	Create an invokable promise . After you create a promise you register its then ( ... ) and catchError ( ... ) and then you use it to handle a callback .
54599	Returns the component at the specified index . Throws an < code > ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException < /code > if the index is negative or not less than the size of the list . < blockquote > < b > Note : < /b > Although this method is not deprecated , the preferred method to use is < code > get ( int ) < /code > , which implements the < code > List < /code > interface defined in the 1.2 Collections framework . < /blockquote >
54606	Returns an unmodifiable view of the specified sorted map . This method allows modules to provide users with `` read-only '' access to internal sorted maps . Query operations on the returned sorted map `` read through '' to the specified sorted map . Attempts to modify the returned sorted map , whether direct , via its collection views , or via its < tt > subMap < /tt > , < tt > headMap < /tt > , or < tt > tailMap < /tt > views , result in an < tt > UnsupportedOperationException < /tt > . < p > The returned sorted map will be serializable if the specified sorted map is serializable .
54608	Returns true if this either implements the interface argument or is directly or indirectly a wrapper for an object that does . Returns false otherwise . If this implements the interface then return true , else if this is a wrapper then return the result of recursively calling < code > isWrapperFor < /code > on the wrapped object . If this does not implement the interface and is not a wrapper , return false . This method should be implemented as a low-cost operation compared to < code > unwrap < /code > so that callers can use this method to avoid expensive < code > unwrap < /code > calls that may fail . If this method returns true then calling < code > unwrap < /code > with the same argument should succeed .
54616	Returns true if the Icon < code > icon < /code > is an instance of ImageIcon , and the image it contains is the same as < code > image < /code > .
54617	Returns the DN to use for searching children of a given node . In most cases , it 's node.getDN ( ) . However if node has referral data and _followReferrals is true , the result is calculated from the referral resolution .
54621	Returns < code > true < /code > if there is a controller installed for this < code > IIOParam < /code > object . This will return < code > true < /code > if < code > getController < /code > would not return < code > null < /code > .
54623	Invoke this method , rather than throwing an Exception , for situations where user/server input might reasonably cause this to occur , and thus do n't want an exception thrown at production time , but do want logging notification .
54625	Closing a < tt > StringWriter < /tt > has no effect . The methods in this class can be called after the stream has been closed without generating an < tt > IOException < /tt > .
54626	Adds the specified < code > DragSourceMotionListener < /code > to this < code > DragSource < /code > to receive drag motion events during drag operations intiated with this < code > DragSource < /code > . If a < code > null < /code > listener is specified , no action is taken and no exception is thrown .
54632	Repaints the specified rectangle of this component within < code > time < /code > milliseconds . Refer to < code > RepaintManager < /code > for details on how the repaint is handled .
54635	Creates a new URL by adding the provided path to the end of the provided server 's URL . This assumes that the provided server URL does not include the deployment path of OpenAM since it can be assumed to be the same as this server 's deployment path . e.g . Given the server URL `` https : //remote.example.com:8080 '' and the path `` GetHttpSession ? op=create '' , if this OpenAM server is deployed to `` /openam '' then the resulting URL will be https : //remote.example.com:8080/openam/GetHttpSession ? op=create
54636	Creates the default renderer that will be used in a non-editiable combo box . A default renderer will used only if a renderer has not been explicitly set with < code > setRenderer < /code > .
54645	Retrieve object hash code and applies a supplemental hash function to the result hash , which defends against poor quality hash functions . This is critical because HashMap uses power-of-two length hash tables , that otherwise encounter collisions for hashCodes that do not differ in lower bits .
54648	Returns true if < code > field < /code > is non-null . Subclasses that wish to allow incrementing to happen outside of the known fields will need to override this .
54651	Cause the caret to be painted . The repaint area is the bounding box of the caret ( i.e . the caret rectangle or < em > this < /em > ) . < p > This method is thread safe , although most Swing methods are not . Please see < A HREF= '' https : //docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html '' > Concurrency in Swing < /A > for more information .
54659	Clears the instance after the tests so that it 's memory can be reclaimed . This can actually be quite a bit of memory since it references the Schema , ConfigEntryS , etc
54665	Retains only the elements in this set that are contained in the specified collection . In other words , removes from this set all of its elements that are not contained in the specified collection . If the specified collection is also a set , this operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the < i > intersection < /i > of the two sets .
54669	Parse the given Java class file and return an object that represents the contained data , i.e. , constants , methods , fields and commands . A < em > ClassFormatException < /em > is raised , if the file is not a valid .class file . ( This does not include verification of the byte code as it is performed by the java interpreter ) .
54673	deserialize contents ... if this instance has a distinct peer the children are *not* serialized here , the peer 's readObject ( ) must call readChildren ( ) after deserializing this instance .
54713	Return the external form of the URL representing this TLD . This can be used as a canonical location for the TLD itself , for example , as the systemId to use when parsing its XML .
54714	Returns an unmodifiable Collection view of the item values contained in this < tt > CompositeData < /tt > instance . The returned collection 's iterator will return the values in the ascending lexicographic order of the corresponding item names .
54723	Resets the cached realm scoped < code > Subject < /code > objects . Would read from persistent store on next access to realm scoped < code > Subject < /code > object
54727	This method will be invoked when a service 's global configuation data has been changed . The parameter groupName denote the name of the configuration grouping ( e.g . default ) and serviceComponent denotes the service 's sub-component that changed ( e.g . /NamedPolicy , /Templates ) .
54729	add the certificates and CRLs contained in the given CertStore to the pool that will be included in the encoded signature block . < p > Note : this assumes the CertStore will support null in the get methods .
54733	Compares the specified Object with this < code > SamplePrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns true if the given object is also a < code > SamplePrincipal < /code > and the two SamplePrincipals have the same username .
54735	Indicates whether the Directory Server is currently configured to operate in the lockdown mode , in which all non-root requests will be rejected and all connection attempts from non-loopback clients will be rejected .
54750	This method will write the contents of the specified byte buffer to the output stream , without filtering . This method is meant to be used to write the response header .
54757	Invokes the < CODE > stopDS < /CODE > method , passing it the provided command line arguments . If the call to < CODE > stopDS < /CODE > returns a nonzero value , then that will be used as the exit code for this program .
54769	Prints error messages only if debug state is greater than Debug.OFF . If the debug file is not accessible and debugging is enabled , the message along with a time stamp and thread info will be printed on < code > System.out < /code > . < /p > < p/ > < p > This method creates the debug file if does not exist ; otherwise it starts appending to the existing debug file . When invoked for the first time on this object , the method writes a line delimiter of '* 's . < /p > < p/ > < p > Note that the debug file will remain open until < code > destroy ( ) < /code > is invoked . To conserve file resources , you should invoke < code > destroy ( ) < /code > explicitly rather than wait for the garbage collector to clean up . < /p >
54781	Gives notification that something was inserted into the document in a location that this view is responsible for . This is largely delegated to the superclass , but is reimplemented to update the relevant zone ( i.e . determine if a zone needs to be split into a set of 2 or more zones ) .
54787	Prints messages only when the debug state is either Debug.MESSAGE or Debug.ON . < p/ > < p > < b > NOTE : < /b > Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused . Particularly , note that Java evaluates arguments to < code > message ( ) < /code > even when debugging is turned off . So when the argument to this method involves the String concatenation operator '+ ' or any other method invocation , < code > messageEnabled < /code > < b > MUST < /b > be used . It is recommended that the debug state be checked by invoking < code > messageEnabled ( ) < /code > before invoking any < code > message ( ) < /code > methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and maximize application performance . < /p >
54791	See < code > readObject < /code > and < code > writeObject < /code > in < code > JComponent < /code > for more information about serialization in Swing .
54798	Indicates whether to be more flexible in the set of characters allowed for attribute names . The standard requires that only ASCII alphabetic letters , numeric digits , and hyphens be allowed , and that the name start with a letter . If attribute name exceptions are enabled , then underscores will also be allowed , and the name will be allowed to start with a digit .
54801	Creates a new < code > MultiPixelPackedSampleModel < /code > with a subset of the bands of this < code > MultiPixelPackedSampleModel < /code > . Since a < code > MultiPixelPackedSampleModel < /code > only has one band , the bands argument must have a length of one and indicate the zeroth band .
54803	Creates a < code > Service < /code > instance . The specified WSDL document location and service qualified name MUST uniquely identify a < code > wsdl : service < /code > element .
54826	Checks if the requester has the necessary permission to destroy the provided session . The user has the necessary privileges if one of these conditions is fulfilled : < ul > < li > The requester attempts to destroy its own session. < /li > < li > The requester has top level admin role ( having read/write access to any service configuration in the top level realm ) . < /li > < li > The session 's client domain is listed in the requester 's profile under the < code > iplanet-am-session-destroy-sessions service < /code > service attribute. < /li > < /ul >
54840	Copy attributes specified by use-attribute-sets to the result tree . Specifying a use-attribute-sets attribute is equivalent to adding xsl : attribute elements for each of the attributes in each of the named attribute sets to the beginning of the content of the element with the use-attribute-sets attribute , in the same order in which the names of the attribute sets are specified in the use-attribute-sets attribute . It is an error if use of use-attribute-sets attributes on xsl : attribute-set elements causes an attribute set to directly or indirectly use itself .
54863	Searches for filtered roles in this organizational unit using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of filtered roles with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
54872	Checks that the specified value is valid . < p > This validates that the value is within the valid range of values . The field is only used to improve the error message .
54874	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
54877	Returns < code > true < /code > if signing is optional else it will return < code > false < /code > . If signing is optional , sign/verfy < code > Response/Assertion < /code > only if it is required by the specification .
54879	Gets an array copy of all currently logged in players . < p > This method exists for legacy reasons to provide backwards compatibility . It will not exist at runtime and should not be used under any circumstances .
54884	If true , the field is a set of radio buttons ; if false , the field is a check box . This flag only works if the Pushbutton flag is set to false .
54891	Flush the stream . If the stream has saved any characters from the various write ( ) methods in a buffer , write them immediately to their intended destination . Then , if that destination is another character or byte stream , flush it . Thus one flush ( ) invocation will flush all the buffers in a chain of Writers and OutputStreams .
54895	The listener will be notified whenever an event occurs on this < code > RowSet < /code > object . < P > A listener might , for example , be a table or graph that needs to be updated in order to accurately reflect the current state of the < code > RowSet < /code > object . < p > < b > Note < /b > : if the < code > RowSetListener < /code > object is < code > null < /code > , this method silently discards the < code > null < /code > value and does not add a null reference to the set of listeners . < p > < b > Note < /b > : if the listener is already set , and the new < code > RowSetListerner < /code > instance is added to the set of listeners already registered to receive event notifications from this < code > RowSet < /code > .
54905	Append a text node child that will be constructed from a string , to the end of the document . < p > % REVIEW % `` End of the document '' needs to be defined more clearly . Does it become the last child of the Document ? Of the root element ? < /p >
54908	A single preview frame will be returned to the handler supplied . The data will arrive as byte [ ] in the message.obj field , with width and height encoded as message.arg1 and message.arg2 , respectively .
54913	Writes a message to the access logger with information about the search result entry that matches the criteria associated with the provided search operation . < p > The default implementation is to not log anything .
54914	Binds a preference 's summary to its value . More specifically , when the preference 's value is changed , its summary ( line of text below the preference title ) is updated to reflect the value . The summary is also immediately updated upon calling this method . The exact display format is dependent on the type of preference .
54926	Replaces an existing responseProvider object having the same name with the new one . If a < code > ResponseProvider < /code > with the given name does not exist , < code > NameNotFoundException < /code > will be thrown .
54942	Processes an internal bind operation with the provided information . Note that regardless of whether the bind is successful , the authentication state for this internal connection will not be altered in any way .
54968	Returns whether this output device assigned attribute is equivalent to the passed in object . To be equivalent , all of the following conditions must be true : < OL TYPE=1 > < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is not null . < LI > < CODE > object < /CODE > is an instance of class OutputDeviceAssigned . < LI > This output device assigned attribute 's underlying string and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's underlying string are equal . < LI > This output device assigned attribute 's locale and < CODE > object < /CODE > 's locale are equal . < /OL >
54976	Receive notification of the start of a Namespace mapping . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the start of each element ( such as allocating a new tree node or writing output to a file ) . < /p >
54989	Registers a .ttf , .otf , .afm , .pfm , or a .ttc font file . In case if TrueType Collection ( .ttc ) , an additional parameter may be specified defining the index of the font to be registered , e.g . `` path/to/font/collection.ttc,0 '' . The index is zero-based .
54993	Close the stream , flushing it first . Once a stream has been closed , further write ( ) or flush ( ) invocations will cause an IOException to be thrown . Closing a previously-closed stream , however , has no effect .
55003	< p > Performs the upgrade of the specified policy without saving. < /p > < p > The given policy will be updated with the migrated conditions. < /p >
55009	Call this method when a menu item is to be activated . This method handles some of the details of menu item activation such as clearing the selected path and messaging the JMenuItem 's doClick ( ) method .
55025	< p > Receives an HTTP HEAD request from the protected < code > service < /code > method and handles the request . The client sends a HEAD request when it wants to see only the headers of a response , such as Content-Type or Content-Length . The HTTP HEAD method counts the output bytes in the response to set the Content-Length header accurately . < p > If you override this method , you can avoid computing the response body and just set the response headers directly to improve performance . Make sure that the < code > doHead < /code > method you write is both safe and idempotent ( that is , protects itself from being called multiple times for one HTTP HEAD request ) . < p > If the HTTP HEAD request is incorrectly formatted , < code > doHead < /code > returns an HTTP `` Bad Request '' message .
55038	Returns a copy of this period with the specified amount of months . < p > This sets the amount of the months unit in a copy of this period . The years and days units are unaffected . < p > The months unit is not automatically normalized with the years unit . This means that a period of `` 15 months '' is different to a period of `` 1 year and 3 months '' . < p > This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call .
55042	This method is called when the user wants to minimize the frame . The < code > playRestoreDownSound < /code > Action is fired . This action is delegated to the desktopManager .
55046	Test whether the AVT is insensitive to the context in which it is being evaluated . This is intended to facilitate compilation of templates , by allowing simple AVTs to be converted back into strings . Currently the only case we recognize is simple strings . ADDED 9/5/2000 to support compilation experiment
55048	Writes : < br > boolean - true if this certificate has a diff string , false otherwise , followed by < br > writeUTF ( ) of string ( if presented )
55053	Reset this Namespace support object for reuse . < p > It is necessary to invoke this method before reusing the Namespace support object for a new session. < /p >
55060	Specifies that all characters < i > c < /i > in the range < code > low & nbsp ; & lt ; = & nbsp ; < i > c < /i > & nbsp ; & lt ; = & nbsp ; high < /code > are white space characters . White space characters serve only to separate tokens in the input stream . < p > Any other attribute settings for the characters in the specified range are cleared .
55092	Return a quoted string , quoting an < code > int < /code > . Converts an < code > int < /code > to string and quotes it on either side with double quote and returns the quoted string
55099	Registers a resource attribute type with the given short name ( used in RESTful API calls and in the UI ) . Note : short names must be unique across all resource attribute types .
55103	Returns the value of the < code > leadAnchorNotificationEnabled < /code > flag . When < code > leadAnchorNotificationEnabled < /code > is true the model generates notification events with bounds that cover all the changes to the selection plus the changes to the lead and anchor indices . Setting the flag to false causes a narrowing of the event 's bounds to include only the elements that have been selected or deselected since the last change . Either way , the model continues to maintain the lead and anchor variables internally . The default is true . < p > Note : It is possible for the lead or anchor to be changed without a change to the selection . Notification of these changes is often important , such as when the new lead or anchor needs to be updated in the view . Therefore , caution is urged when changing the default value .
55112	Remembers the cdata sections specified in the cdata-section-elements by appending the given cdata section elements to the list . This method can be called multiple times , but once an element is put in the list of cdata section elements it can not be removed . This method should be used by both Xalan and XSLTC .
55145	Encode the body of this header ( the stuff that follows headerName ) . A.K.A headerValue . This will not give a reasonable result for WWW-Authenticate , Authorization , Proxy-Authenticate and Proxy-Authorization and hence this is protected .
55158	Receive notification of a warning . < p > SAX parsers will use this method to report conditions that are not errors or fatal errors as defined by the XML 1.0 recommendation . The default behaviour is to take no action. < /p > < p > The SAX parser must continue to provide normal parsing events after invoking this method : it should still be possible for the application to process the document through to the end. < /p >
55175	Sets up a continuous query on the persistence layer . The results of this query will be returned up to the listener defined . If a continuous query already exists for the provided filter , the listener will be added to the set of listeners for that filter .
55178	Indicates whether the provided object is equal to this byte string builder . In order for it to be considered equal , the provided object must be a byte sequence containing the same bytes in the same order .
55185	Reports an error that occured while scanning . In a wellformed scanner ( no or only correct usage of yypushback ( int ) and a match-all fallback rule ) this method will only be called with things that `` Ca n't Possibly Happen '' . If this method is called , something is seriously wrong ( e.g . a JFlex bug producing a faulty scanner etc. ) . Usual syntax/scanner level error handling should be done in error fallback rules .
55191	Immediately closes the socket connection if it 's currently held by this engine . Use this to interrupt an in-flight request from any thread . It 's the caller 's responsibility to close the request body and response body streams ; otherwise resources may be leaked . < p > This method is safe to be called concurrently , but provides limited guarantees . If a transport layer connection has been established ( such as a HTTP/2 stream ) that is terminated . Otherwise if a socket connection is being established , that is terminated .
55196	Get the contents of a < code > Reader < /code > as a < code > byte [ ] < /code > using the specified character encoding . < p > Character encoding names can be found at < a href= '' http : //www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets '' > IANA < /a > . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedReader < /code > .
55203	This method returns a < code > boolean < /code > indicating if the given < code > DataFlavor < /code > is supported by this < code > DropTargetContext < /code > . < P >
55206	Given the current size of an array , returns an ideal size to which the array should grow . This is typically double the given size , but should not be relied upon to do so in the future .
55213	Adjust indices in starts to reflect a deletion after deleteAt . Any index in starts greater than deleteAt will be increased by 1 . It is the caller 's responsibility to make sure that no 0-length runs result .
55215	Clone an argument of the form passed to setIssuerNames . Throw a RuntimeException if the argument is malformed . < p > This method wraps cloneAndCheckIssuerNames , changing any IOException into a RuntimeException . This method should be used when the object being cloned has already been checked , so there should never be any exceptions .
55221	Schedules the specified task for repeated < i > fixed-delay execution < /i > , beginning at the specified time . Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals , separated by the specified period . < p > In fixed-delay execution , each execution is scheduled relative to the actual execution time of the previous execution . If an execution is delayed for any reason ( such as garbage collection or other background activity ) , subsequent executions will be delayed as well . In the long run , the frequency of execution will generally be slightly lower than the reciprocal of the specified period ( assuming the system clock underlying < tt > Object.wait ( long ) < /tt > is accurate ) . As a consequence of the above , if the scheduled first time is in the past , it is scheduled for immediate execution . < p > Fixed-delay execution is appropriate for recurring activities that require `` smoothness . '' In other words , it is appropriate for activities where it is more important to keep the frequency accurate in the short run than in the long run . This includes most animation tasks , such as blinking a cursor at regular intervals . It also includes tasks wherein regular activity is performed in response to human input , such as automatically repeating a character as long as a key is held down .
55233	Tells whether or not this URI is absolute . < p > A URI is absolute if , and only if , it has a scheme component . < /p >
55236	Appends the income data to be read by handshake protocol . The attempts to overflow the buffer by means of this methods seem to be futile because of : 1 . The SSL protocol specifies the maximum size of the record and record protocol does not pass huge messages . ( see TLS v1 specification http : //www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt , p 6.2 ) 2 . After each call of this method , handshake protocol should start ( and starts ) the operations on received data and recognize the fake data if such was provided ( to check the size of certificate for example ) .
55242	Override DTMDefaultBase._exptype ( ) by dropping the incremental code . < p > This one is less efficient than _exptype2 . It is only used during DTM building . _exptype2 is used after the document is fully built .
55244	Reads a big-endian 16-bit short from the current position in this file . Blocks until two bytes have been read , the end of the file is reached or an exception is thrown .
55283	Decrements the count of the latch , releasing all waiting threads if the count reaches zero . < p > If the current count is greater than zero then it is decremented . If the new count is zero then all waiting threads are re-enabled for thread scheduling purposes . < p > If the current count equals zero then nothing happens .
55288	Resets this < code > Polygon < /code > object to an empty polygon . The coordinate arrays and the data in them are left untouched but the number of points is reset to zero to mark the old vertex data as invalid and to start accumulating new vertex data at the beginning . All internally-cached data relating to the old vertices are discarded . Note that since the coordinate arrays from before the reset are reused , creating a new empty < code > Polygon < /code > might be more memory efficient than resetting the current one if the number of vertices in the new polygon data is significantly smaller than the number of vertices in the data from before the reset .
55289	Appends a line to the logs ( Details are ) section of the panel . The text will be preceded by a new line ( is similar to println ( ) ) .
55292	A single preview frame will be returned to the handler supplied . The data will arrive as byte [ ] in the message.obj field , with width and height encoded as message.arg1 and message.arg2 , respectively .
55294	Launches the associated application to open the file . < p > If the specified file is a directory , the file manager of the current platform is launched to open it .
55301	Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the key properties . < p > An object name is a pattern on the key properties if it is a pattern on the key property list ( e.g . `` d : k=v , * '' ) or on the property values ( e.g . `` d : k=* '' ) or on both ( e.g . `` d : k=* , * '' ) .
55308	Determines in which direction the next view lays . Consider the < code > View < /code > at index n. Typically the < code > View < /code > s are layed out from left to right , so that the < code > View < /code > to the EAST will be at index n + 1 , and the < code > View < /code > to the WEST will be at index n - 1 . In certain situations , such as with bidirectional text , it is possible that the < code > View < /code > to EAST is not at index n + 1 , but rather at index n - 1 , or that the < code > View < /code > to the WEST is not at index n - 1 , but index n + 1 . In this case this method would return true , indicating the < code > View < /code > s are layed out in descending order . < p > This will return true if the text is layed out right to left at position , otherwise false .
55314	Receive notification of a recoverable error . < p > This corresponds to the definition of `` error '' in section 1.2 of the W3C XML 1.0 Recommendation . For example , a validating parser would use this callback to report the violation of a validity constraint . The default behaviour is to take no action. < /p > < p > The SAX parser must continue to provide normal parsing events after invoking this method : it should still be possible for the application to process the document through to the end . If the application can not do so , then the parser should report a fatal error even if the XML 1.0 recommendation does not require it to do so. < /p >
55316	See the general contract of the < code > readChar < /code > method of < code > DataInput < /code > . < p > Bytes for this operation are read from the contained input stream .
55317	< p > Provide a hook for lazy configuration of this < code > Digester < /code > instance . The default implementation does nothing , but subclasses can override as needed . < /p > < p > < strong > Note < /strong > This method may be called more than once . < /p >
55322	In this scenario , the fake RS will not send back an ack so we expect the add entry code ( LDAP client code emulation ) to be blocked for the timeout value at least . If the time we have slept is lower , timeout handling code is not working ...
55326	Copy bytes from an < code > InputStream < /code > to an < code > OutputStream < /code > . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > . < p > Large streams ( over 2GB ) will return a bytes copied value of < code > -1 < /code > after the copy has completed since the correct number of bytes can not be returned as an int . For large streams use the < code > copyLarge ( InputStream , OutputStream ) < /code > method .
55345	Creates an invisible , fixed-height component . In a vertical box , you typically use this method to force a certain amount of space between two components . In a horizontal box , you might use this method to force the box to be at least the specified height . The invisible component has no width unless excess space is available , in which case it takes its share of available space , just like any other component that has no maximum width .
55350	Writes a < code > short < /code > to the underlying output stream as two bytes , high byte first . If no exception is thrown , the counter < code > written < /code > is incremented by < code > 2 < /code > .
55378	< p > Are info messages currently enabled ? < /p > < p > This allows expensive operations such as < code > String < /code > concatenation to be avoided when the message will be ignored by the logger . < /p >
55381	Class loader resources are handled by treating JARs in WEB-INF/lib as resource JARs ( without the internal META-INF/resources/ prefix ) mounted at WEB-INF/classes ( rather than the web app root ) . This enables reuse of the resource handling plumbing . These resources are marked as class loader only so they are only used in the methods that are explicitly defined to return class loader resources . This prevents calls to getResource ( `` /WEB-INF/classes '' ) returning from one or more of the JAR files .
55386	Increments the iterator 's index by one and returns the character at the new index . If the resulting index is greater or equal to getEndIndex ( ) , the current index is reset to getEndIndex ( ) and a value of DONE is returned .
55414	Escape quotes , \ , / , \r , \n , \b , \f , \t and other control characters ( U+0000 through U+001F ) . It 's the same as JSONValue.escape ( ) only for compatibility here .
55417	Is this tag empty < p > Overridden because check for size of one because there is always a vendor tag unless just created an empty vorbis tag as part of flac tag in which case size could be zero
55420	Determines whether the specified RDN sequence forms a suffix of this LDAP name . Returns true if this LdapName is at least as long as rdns , and for every position p in the range [ size ( ) - rdns.size ( ) , size ( ) ) the component getRdn ( p ) matches rdns.get ( p ) . Returns false otherwise . If rdns is null , false is returned .
55421	Initializes this extended operation handler based on the information in the provided configuration entry . It should also register itself with the Directory Server for the particular kinds of extended operations that it will process .
55437	Processes listener event , this method will remove configuration from the configuration cache , also remove the listener from the listened object , such as < code > AMUser < /code > , < code > AMRole < /code > , or SM Service .
55441	Adds the specified < code > ImageConsumer < /code > to the list of consumers interested in data for the filtered image . An instance of the original < code > ImageFilter < /code > is created ( using the filter 's < code > getFilterInstance < /code > method ) to manipulate the image data for the specified < code > ImageConsumer < /code > . The newly created filter instance is then passed to the < code > addConsumer < /code > method of the original < code > ImageProducer < /code > . < p > This method is public as a side effect of this class implementing the < code > ImageProducer < /code > interface . It should not be called from user code , and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified .
55447	< p > Initialize a cache by name . < /p > < p/ > < p > Caches require initialization before use . Be careful to initialize your cache before using it . Initializing a cache that has already been initialized once does nothing . < /p > < p/ > < p > The cache manager will check jive module context for overriding defaultMaxCacheSize values . The property names should be `` cache.name.size '' where 'name ' will be the same as the cache name . If the property exists , that value will be used instead of the defaultMaxCacheSize . < /p >
55448	Binds a new name to the object bound to an old name , and unbinds the old name . Both names are relative to this context . Any attributes associated with the old name become associated with the new name . Intermediate contexts of the old name are not changed .
55450	Unbinds the named object . Removes the terminal atomic name in name from the target context -- that named by all but the terminal atomic part of name . < p > This method is idempotent . It succeeds even if the terminal atomic name is not bound in the target context , but throws NameNotFoundException if any of the intermediate contexts do not exist .
55459	Add components from 'name ' as the last components in remaining name . < p > < tt > name < /tt > is a composite name . If the intent is to append a compound name , you should `` stringify '' the compound name then invoke the overloaded form that accepts a String parameter . < p > Subsequent changes to < code > name < /code > does not affect the remaining name field in this NamingException and vice versa .
55465	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
55466	Returns the resulting multicast listener from adding listener-a and listener-b together . If listener-a is null , it returns listener-b ; If listener-b is null , it returns listener-a If neither are null , then it creates and returns a new AWTEventMulticaster instance which chains a with b .
55469	Calls < code > dragEnter < /code > on the < code > DragSourceListener < /code > s registered with this < code > DragSourceContext < /code > and with the associated < code > DragSource < /code > , and passes them the specified < code > DragSourceDragEvent < /code > .
55497	Determines the lowest ( rightmost ) bit of the specified integer that is 1 and returns the bit mask value for that bit . This is also referred to as the Least Significant 1 Bit . Returns zero if the specified integer is zero .
55501	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object . It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy ( ) to avoid resource leaks . Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid . Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST . It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained .
55507	Removes a unicode locale attribute , if present , otherwise has no effect . The attribute must not be null and must be < a href= '' ./Locale.html # def_locale_extension '' > well-formed < /a > or an exception is thrown . < p > Attribute comparision for removal is case-insensitive .
55528	Gives notification that something was inserted into the document in a location that this view is responsible for . If either parameter is < code > null < /code > , behavior of this method is implementation dependent .
55551	Indicates whether this sub-command will allow unnamed trailing arguments . These will be arguments at the end of the list that are not preceded by either a long or short identifier and will need to be manually parsed by the application using this parser . Note that once an unnamed trailing argument has been identified , all remaining arguments will be classified as such .
55554	Reads a single byte from the source string and returns it as an integer in the range from 0 to 255 . Returns -1 if the end of the source string has been reached .
55562	Returns true if the specified character can be considered markup . Markup characters include ' & lt ; ' , ' & amp ; ' , and ' % ' .
55566	Creates a new < code > DragGestureRecognizer < /code > that implements the specified abstract subclass of < code > DragGestureRecognizer < /code > , and sets the specified < code > Component < /code > and < code > DragGestureListener < /code > on the newly created object . < P >
55568	Serializes an < code > XMPMeta < /code > -object as RDF into a string . < em > Note : < /em > Encoding is ignored when serializing to a string .
55569	Returns 0 after EOF has reached for the current entry data , otherwise always return 1 . < p > Programs should not count on this method to return the actual number of bytes that could be read without blocking .
55576	Whether the arguments provided by the user , indicate that the task should be executed immediately . < br > This method assumes that the arguments have already been parsed and validated .
55582	Returns < code > true < /code > if this < code > IIOImage < /code > stores a < code > Raster < /code > rather than a < code > RenderedImage < /code > .
55585	Returns the raw response received from the cache . Will be null if this response did n't use the cache . For conditional get requests the cache response and network response may both be non-null . The body of the returned response should not be read .
55587	Attempts to send this message to the intended recipient ( s ) . This will use the mail server ( s ) defined in the Directory Server mail handler configuration . If multiple servers are specified and the first is unavailable , then the other server ( s ) will be tried before returning a failure to the caller .
55604	Removes the first occurrence of the specified page from this document , if it is present . Returns < tt > true < /tt > if this document contained the specified element ( or equivalently , if this document changed as a result of the call ) .
55610	Returns < tt > true < /tt > if this list contains the specified element . More formally , returns < tt > true < /tt > if and only if this list contains at least one element < tt > e < /tt > such that < tt > ( o==null & nbsp ; ? & nbsp ; e==null & nbsp ; : & nbsp ; o.equals ( e ) ) < /tt > .
55611	Writes a message to the access logger with information about the modify DN response associated with the provided modify DN operation . < p > The default implementation is to not log anything .
55624	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
55635	This method looks for an extended content description object in this header instance , if not found there , it tries to get one from a contained ASF header extension object .
55637	Returns a SOAP request compliant with JAXRPC for the provide function name < code > function < /code > that takes the parameter < code > param < /code > as the only argument .
55642	Clears the cached membership evaluation results corresponding to the < code > tokenIdString < /code > . This is triggered through < code > PolicySSOTokenListener < /code > , < code > PolicyCache < /code > and < code > Policy < /code > when session property of a logged in user is changed
55643	< p > Subclasses of this class may override , or envelope , this method to add validation behavior for the BeanContext to examine child objects immediately prior to their being added to the BeanContext . < /p >
55655	Returns 0 after EOF has been reached , otherwise always return 1 . < p > Programs should not count on this method to return the actual number of bytes that could be read without blocking
55658	Serializes an object and returns the Base64-encoded version of that serialized object . < p > As of v 2.3 , if the object can not be serialized or there is another error , the method will throw an java.io.IOException . < b > This is new to v2.3 ! < /b > In earlier versions , it just returned a null value , but in retrospect that 's a pretty poor way to handle it. < /p > The object is not GZip-compressed before being encoded .
55681	Deletes the components at the specified range of indexes . The removal is inclusive , so specifying a range of ( 1,5 ) removes the component at index 1 and the component at index 5 , as well as all components in between . < p > Throws an < code > ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException < /code > if the index was invalid . Throws an < code > IllegalArgumentException < /code > if < code > fromIndex & gt ; toIndex < /code > .
55688	Sets the < code > JViewport < /code > 's one lightweight child , which can be < code > null < /code > . ( Since there is only one child which occupies the entire viewport , the < code > constraints < /code > and < code > index < /code > arguments are ignored . )
55691	Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method to take specific actions for each chunk of ignorable whitespace ( such as adding data to a node or buffer , or printing it to a file ) . < /p >
55696	Manipulates the map once available . This callback is triggered when the map is ready to be used . This is where we can add markers or lines , add listeners or move the camera . In this case , we just add a marker near Sydney , Australia . If Google Play services is not installed on the device , the user will be prompted to install it inside the SupportMapFragment . This method will only be triggered once the user has installed Google Play services and returned to the app .
55700	Returns a new object with cropped image data . Implementations may keep a reference to the original data rather than a copy . Only callable if isCropSupported ( ) is true .
55704	Remove multiple properties from an XMP object . RemoveProperties was created to support the File Info dialog 's Delete button , and has been been generalized somewhat from those specific needs . It operates in one of three main modes depending on the schemaNS and propName parameters : < ul > < li > Non-empty < code > schemaNS < /code > and < code > propName < /code > - The named property is removed if it is an external property , or if the flag < code > doAllProperties < /code > option is true . It does not matter whether the named property is an actual property or an alias . < li > Non-empty < code > schemaNS < /code > and empty < code > propName < /code > - The all external properties in the named schema are removed . Internal properties are also removed if the flag < code > doAllProperties < /code > option is set . In addition , aliases from the named schema will be removed if the flag < code > includeAliases < /code > option is set . < li > Empty < code > schemaNS < /code > and empty < code > propName < /code > - All external properties in all schema are removed . Internal properties are also removed if the flag < code > doAllProperties < /code > option is passed . Aliases are implicitly handled because the associated actuals are internal if the alias is . < /ul > It is an error to pass an empty < code > schemaNS < /code > and non-empty < code > propName < /code > .
55724	A dummy routine to satisify the abstract interface . If the DTM implememtation that extends the default base requires notification when the document is being released , they can override this method
55726	Returns a multiplexing UI instance if any of the auxiliary < code > LookAndFeel < /code > s supports this UI . Otherwise , just returns the UI object obtained from the default < code > LookAndFeel < /code > .
55728	This method is called by installUI to get the editor component of the < code > JSpinner < /code > . By default it just returns < code > JSpinner.getEditor ( ) < /code > . Subclasses can override < code > createEditor < /code > to return a component that contains the spinner 's editor or null , if they 're going to handle adding the editor to the < code > JSpinner < /code > in an < code > installUI < /code > override . < p > Typically this method would be overridden to wrap the editor with a container with a custom border , since one ca n't assume that the editors border can be set directly . < p > The < code > replaceEditor < /code > method is called when the spinners editor is changed with < code > JSpinner.setEditor < /code > . If you 've overriden this method , then you 'll probably want to override < code > replaceEditor < /code > as well .
55729	Recreate the EGLSurface , using the new EglBase . The caller should have already freed the old EGLSurface with releaseEglSurface ( ) . < p > This is useful when we want to update the EGLSurface associated with a Surface . For example , if we want to share with a different EGLContext , which can only be done by tearing down and recreating the context . ( That 's handled by the caller ; this just creates a new EGLSurface for the Surface we were handed earlier . ) < p > If the previous EGLSurface is n't fully destroyed , e.g . it 's still current on a context somewhere , the create call will fail with complaints from the Surface about already being connected .
55731	Encodes an Object using the soundex algorithm . This method is provided in order to satisfy the requirements of the Encoder interface , and will throw an EncoderException if the supplied object is not of type java.lang.String .
55741	If < code > constraints < /code > is an instance of < code > SpringLayout.Constraints < /code > , associates the constraints with the specified component . < p >
55742	Log a FINER message , which is only to be constructed if the logging level is such that the message will actually be logged . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the FINER message level then the message is constructed by invoking the provided supplier function and forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
55745	Forces this phaser to enter termination state . Counts of registered parties are unaffected . If this phaser is a member of a tiered set of phasers , then all of the phasers in the set are terminated . If this phaser is already terminated , this method has no effect . This method may be useful for coordinating recovery after one or more tasks encounter unexpected exceptions .
55747	Push messages with only one socket at a time Wait for ack is needed and make auto retry when write message is failed . After sending error close and reopen socket again . After successful sending update stats WARNING : Subclasses must be very careful that only one thread call this pushMessage at once ! ! !
55761	Retrieves the next operation that should be processed by one of the worker threads , blocking if necessary until a new request arrives . This method should only be called by a worker thread associated with this work queue .
55764	Determines whether the specified object is equal to this < code > Expression < /code > . < p > The result is < code > true < /code > if and only if the argument is not < code > null < /code > , is an < code > Expression < /code > object that is the of the same type ( < code > ValueExpression < /code > or < code > MethodExpression < /code > ) , and has an identical parsed representation . < /p > < p > Note that two expressions can be equal if their expression Strings are different . For example , < code > $ { fn1 : foo ( ) } < /code > and < code > $ { fn2 : foo ( ) } < /code > are equal if their corresponding < code > FunctionMapper < /code > s mapped < code > fn1 : foo < /code > and < code > fn2 : foo < /code > to the same method . < /p >
55775	Processes item events occurring on this list by dispatching them to any registered < code > ItemListener < /code > objects . < p > This method is not called unless item events are enabled for this component . Item events are enabled when one of the following occurs : < ul > < li > An < code > ItemListener < /code > object is registered via < code > addItemListener < /code > . < li > Item events are enabled via < code > enableEvents < /code > . < /ul > < p > Note that if the event parameter is < code > null < /code > the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception .
55778	A factory method used for the creation of new XML elements that can be added to this XML document at a later stage . When this method is called , a new < code > XMLElement < /code > object is returned to the caller . However , this newly created element is still not attached to the document anywhere and it is the responsiblity of the caller to attach it in the appropriate location . Further , the element returned from this method is a collapsed element that is contained within a single bounded token .
55793	Overridden to make clone public . Returns a shallow copy of this node ; the new node has no parent or children and has a reference to the same user object , if any .
55802	Simple check if a character is a valid XML name char ( every char except the first one ) , according to the XML Spec 1.1 : http : //www.w3.org/TR/xml11/ # NT-NameChar
55811	Returns an unmodifiable Set view of all the item names defined by this < code > CompositeType < /code > instance . The set 's iterator will return the item names in ascending order .
55813	Retrieves the native byte order of the underlying platform . < p > This method is defined so that performance-sensitive Java code can allocate direct buffers with the same byte order as the hardware . Native code libraries are often more efficient when such buffers are used . < /p >
55815	Searches for dynamic groups in this organization using wildcards and attribute values . Wildcards can be specified such as a* , * , *a . To further refine the search , attribute-value pairs can be specifed so that DNs of dynamic groups with matching attribute-value pairs will be returned .
55816	Adds the components of a compound name -- in order -- at a specified position within this compound name . Components of this compound name at or after the index of the first new component are shifted up ( away from index 0 ) to accommodate the new components . < p > Implementation note : Currently the syntax properties of suffix is not used or checked . They might be in the future .
55820	Creates and returns an enumeration that traverses the subtree rooted at this node in depth-first order . The first node returned by the enumeration 's < code > nextElement ( ) < /code > method is the leftmost leaf . This is the same as a postorder traversal. < P > Modifying the tree by inserting , removing , or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification .
55826	The superclass behavior will try to update the child views which is not desired in this case , since the children are zones and not directly effected by the changes to the associated element . This is reimplemented to do nothing and return false .
55831	Log a INFO message , which is only to be constructed if the logging level is such that the message will actually be logged . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the INFO message level then the message is constructed by invoking the provided supplier function and forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
55843	Adds an observer to the set of observers for this object , provided that it is not the same as some observer already in the set . The order in which notifications will be delivered to multiple observers is not specified . See the class comment .
55855	Adds a single component at a specified position within this compound name . Components of this compound name at or after the index of the new component are shifted up by one ( away from index 0 ) to accommodate the new component .
55892	Checks if the provided < code > String < /code > is URLEncoded . Our logic is simple . If the string has % or + character we treat as URL encoded < p/ > TODO : Copied from AuthClientUtils , refactor
55897	Renders using the given rendering surface and area on that surface . The view may need to do layout and create child views to enable itself to render into the given allocation .
55902	Checks whether a character is a valid token character . Whitespace , control characters , and HTTP separators are not valid token characters . The HTTP specification ( RFC 2616 , section 2.2 ) defines tokens only for the US-ASCII character set , this method extends the definition to other character sets .
55911	calculates for each line a shape around this line where the right and left edge lines have the distance p_half_width from the center line Returns an array of convex shapes of length line_count - 2
55917	Creates the missing workflows , one for the config backend and one for the rootDSE backend . This method should be invoked whatever may be the workflow configuration mode because config backend and rootDSE backend will not have any configuration section , ever .
55925	Selects the node identified by the specified path and initiates editing . The edit-attempt fails if the < code > CellEditor < /code > does not allow editing for the specified item .
55933	Creates an < code > ItemListener < /code > which will be added to the combo box . If this method returns null then it will not be added to the combo box . < p > Subclasses may override this method to return instances of their own ItemEvent handlers .
55936	Returns whether calls to < code > add < /code > and < code > setLayout < /code > are forwarded to the < code > contentPane < /code > .
55940	Reset this Namespace support object for reuse . < p > It is necessary to invoke this method before reusing the Namespace support object for a new session . If namespace declaration URIs are to be supported , that flag must also be set to a non-default value . < /p >
55948	Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method to take specific actions for each chunk of ignorable whitespace ( such as adding data to a node or buffer , or printing it to a file ) . < /p >
55968	Tests whether a file is writable . This method checks that a file exists and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges that would allow it open the file for writing . Depending on the implementation , this method may require to read file permissions , access control lists , or other file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file . Consequently , this method may not be atomic with respect to other file system operations . < p > Note that result of this method is immediately outdated , there is no guarantee that a subsequent attempt to open the file for writing will succeed ( or even that it will access the same file ) . Care should be taken when using this method in security sensitive applications .
55983	Receive notification of a skipped entity . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each processing instruction , such as setting status variables or invoking other methods. < /p >
55984	Compares this string to the specified object . The result is < code > true < /code > if and only if the argument is not < code > null < /code > and is a < code > String < /code > object that represents the same sequence of characters as this object .
56002	The number 's int value . < i > Note : Even though the number 's type might be INTEGER it can be larger than a Java int . Use intValue ( ) only if you are certain that it contains a number from the int range . Otherwise the value might be innaccurate. < /i >
56007	Set the received address and port in the packet . We do this when the Datagram socket is connected at the native level and the recvConnnectedDatagramImpl does not update the packet with address from which the packet was received
56015	Brings up a dialog with a specified icon , where the number of choices is determined by the < code > optionType < /code > parameter . The < code > messageType < /code > parameter is primarily used to supply a default icon from the look and feel .
56020	reads the value of with Key < code > sourceKey < /code > in component < code > component < /code > , then gets the response writer and add attribute with with Key < code > targetKey < /code > and value equal to the retrieved previous value in case the retrieved value equal null then the value of < code > defaultValue < /code > will be used instead Also in case < code > targetKey < /code > equal null then < code > sourceKey < /code > will be used instead .
56026	Returns the number of bytes currently being used to store the values in this cache . This may be greater than the max size if a background deletion is pending .
56030	Determines whether each attribute in the attribute set is valid for the given organization . Iterates though the set checking each element to see if there is a validator that needs to execute .
56031	Returns an integer indicating the position of < code > spot < /code > in < code > width < /code > . The return value will be : 0 if < BORDER_DRAG_THICKNESS 1 if < CORNER_DRAG_WIDTH 2 if > = CORNER_DRAG_WIDTH & & < width - BORDER_DRAG_THICKNESS 3 if > = width - CORNER_DRAG_WIDTH 4 if > = width - BORDER_DRAG_THICKNESS 5 otherwise
56039	Prints the stack trace of the root exception to standard error stream . Also prints the messages of all the exceptions starting from top exception to the root exception , at the top of stack trace
56051	Attempts to reduce storage used for this byte string builder . If the buffer is larger than necessary to hold its current sequence of bytes , then it may be resized to become more space efficient .
56061	Tests this abstract pathname for equality with the given object . Returns < code > true < /code > if and only if the argument is not < code > null < /code > and is an abstract pathname that denotes the same file or directory as this abstract pathname . Whether or not two abstract pathnames are equal depends upon the underlying system . On UNIX systems , alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames ; on Microsoft Windows systems it is not .
56062	If a list item is a separator ( acting as separate items and other item to , also can not the same but not click ) , returns true , that is , you can click and then receive a response event . If , at the time the position of the item is the separator , return false , also can not respond to a click or touch events , this project is not clickable , is expressed in the form of point without any reaction can act as a list of partitions , of course , can be separated by this custom layout
56080	Links edge < code > e1 < /code > of component < code > c1 < /code > to edge < code > e2 < /code > of component < code > c2 < /code > . As edge < code > ( e2 , c2 ) < /code > changes value , edge < code > ( e1 , c1 ) < /code > will be calculated by taking the ( spring ) sum of < code > ( e2 , c2 ) < /code > and < code > s < /code > . Each edge must have one of the following values : < code > SpringLayout.NORTH < /code > , < code > SpringLayout.SOUTH < /code > , < code > SpringLayout.EAST < /code > , < code > SpringLayout.WEST < /code > , < code > SpringLayout.VERTICAL_CENTER < /code > , < code > SpringLayout.HORIZONTAL_CENTER < /code > or < code > SpringLayout.BASELINE < /code > . < p >
56084	Returns whether this node is the same node as the given one . < br > This method provides a way to determine whether two < code > Node < /code > references returned by the implementation reference the same object . When two < code > Node < /code > references are references to the same object , even if through a proxy , the references may be used completely interchangably , such that all attributes have the same values and calling the same DOM method on either reference always has exactly the same effect .
56090	Returns the single byte at the given position , as an < code > int < /code > . Returns -1 if this position has not been cached or has been disposed .
56097	Marshals the value in this < code > ServiceInformationHolder < /code > object 's < code > value < /code > field to the output stream < code > out < /code > .
56099	Ensures Docussandra is presently running . The rest endpoints will be exposed on port 19080 . Cassandra will be mocked internally instead of relying on a external process ; no data will be saved past the JVM shutdown .
56100	Returns a Set view of the keys contained in this Cache . The Set is backed by the Cache , so changes to the Cache are reflected in the Set , and vice-versa . The Set supports element removal ( which removes the corresponding entry from the Cache ) , but not element addition .
56109	Finds the implementation < code > Class < /code > object for the given factory name , or if that fails , finds the < code > Class < /code > object for the given fallback class name . The arguments supplied must be used in order . If using the first argument is successful , the second one will not be used . < P > This method is package private so that this code can be shared .
56111	Returns whether the the < code > lr < /code > parameter is set . This is equivalent to hasParameter ( `` lr '' ) . This interface has no getLrParam as RFC3261 does not specify any values for the `` lr '' paramater .
56113	Called as the cursor 's hotspot exits a platform-dependent drop site . This method is invoked when any of the following conditions are true : < UL > < LI > The cursor 's hotspot no longer intersects the operable part of the drop site associated with the previous dragEnter ( ) invocation . < /UL > OR < UL > < LI > The drop site associated with the previous dragEnter ( ) invocation is no longer active . < /UL > OR < UL > < LI > The drop site associated with the previous dragEnter ( ) invocation has rejected the drag . < /UL >
56115	Schedules the specified task for repeated < i > fixed-rate execution < /i > , beginning after the specified delay . Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals , separated by the specified period . < p > In fixed-rate execution , each execution is scheduled relative to the scheduled execution time of the initial execution . If an execution is delayed for any reason ( such as garbage collection or other background activity ) , two or more executions will occur in rapid succession to `` catch up . '' In the long run , the frequency of execution will be exactly the reciprocal of the specified period ( assuming the system clock underlying < tt > Object.wait ( long ) < /tt > is accurate ) . < p > Fixed-rate execution is appropriate for recurring activities that are sensitive to < i > absolute < /i > time , such as ringing a chime every hour on the hour , or running scheduled maintenance every day at a particular time . It is also appropriate for recurring activities where the total time to perform a fixed number of executions is important , such as a countdown timer that ticks once every second for ten seconds . Finally , fixed-rate execution is appropriate for scheduling multiple repeating timer tasks that must remain synchronized with respect to one another .
56120	< p > Converts the string argument into a byte value . < p > String parameter < tt > lexicalXSDQname < /tt > must conform to lexical value space specifed at < a href= '' http : //www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/ # QName '' > XML Schema Part 2 : Datatypes specification : QNames < /a >
56123	Returns a PermissionCollection object for storing ServicePermission objects . < br > ServicePermission objects must be stored in a manner that allows them to be inserted into the collection in any order , but that also enables the PermissionCollection implies method to be implemented in an efficient ( and consistent ) manner .
56134	Enumerates the names bound in the named context , along with the objects bound to them . The contents of any subcontexts are not included . < p > If a binding is added to or removed from this context , its effect on an enumeration previously returned is undefined .
56137	This method is a bit weird ... Return true if you are a common class OR your uncommon parts are empty . Empty uncommon parts implies the NBT data would be equivalent if both were applied to an item
56142	Increments the count of unstarted threads in the thread group . Unstarted threads are not added to the thread group so that they can be collected if they are never started , but they must be counted so that daemon thread groups with unstarted threads in them are not destroyed .
56148	Returning true indicates the row under the mouse should be toggled based on the event . This is invoked after checkForClickInExpandControl , implying the location is not in the expand ( toggle ) control
56156	Marks the fieldName as valid or invalid depending on the value of the invalid parameter . With the current implementation this implies basically using a red color in the label associated with the fieldName object . The color/style used to mark the label invalid is specified in UIFactory .
56164	Inserts the specified node in this vector at the specified index . Each component in this vector with an index greater or equal to the specified index is shifted upward to have an index one greater than the value it had previously .
56201	Returns a string representation of this JRadioButton . This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes , and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations . The returned string may be empty but may not be < code > null < /code > .
56202	Opens a new session with publish permissions . If either applicationID is null , this method will default to using the value from the associated meta-data value . The permissions list can not be null .
56206	subclasses may override this method to simply extend remove ( ) semantics after the child has been removed and before the event notification has occurred . The method is called with the child synchronized .
56207	Returns the < code > index < /code > th item in the collection . If < code > index < /code > is greater than or equal to the number of nodes in the list , this returns < code > null < /code > .
56222	This method is only used internally when flushing the writer from the various fire ... ( ) trace events . Due to the writer being wrapped with SerializerTraceWriter it may cause the flush of these trace events : EVENTTYPE_OUTPUT_PSEUDO_CHARACTERS EVENTTYPE_OUTPUT_CHARACTERS which trace the output written to the output stream .
56224	Called when the HandshakeRequest is no longer required . Since an instance of this class retains a reference to the current HttpServletRequest that reference needs to be cleared as the HttpServletRequest may be reused . There is no reason for instances of this class to be accessed once the handshake has been completed .
56243	Get the contents of an < code > InputStream < /code > as a String using the default character encoding of the platform . < p > This method buffers the input internally , so there is no need to use a < code > BufferedInputStream < /code > .
56244	subclasses may override this method to simply extend add ( ) semantics after the child has been added and before the event notification has occurred . The method is called with the child synchronized .
56248	Call a method by its name . < p > This is a convenience method for calling < code > call ( name , new Object [ 0 ] ) < /code >
56259	Log a message , specifying source class and method , with no arguments . < p > If the logger is currently enabled for the given message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects . < p >
56263	Removes an existing component . When a new component , such as the left corner , or vertical scrollbar , is added , the old one , if it exists , must be removed . < p > This method returns < code > newC < /code > . If < code > oldC < /code > is not equal to < code > newC < /code > and is non- < code > null < /code > , it will be removed from its parent .
56268	Returns < code > true < /code > if the data store has successfully authenticated the identity with the provided credentials . In case the data store requires additional credentials , the list would be returned via the < code > IdRepoException < /code > exception .
56274	Writes < code > len < /code > bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset < code > off < /code > to the underlying output stream . If no exception is thrown , the counter < code > written < /code > is incremented by < code > len < /code > .
56281	Compares the specified Object with this < code > JDBCPrincipal < /code > for equality . Returns < code > true < /code > if the given object is also a < code > JDBCPrincipal < /code > and the two JDBCPrincipals have the same user name .
56286	Create an invokable promise handle . After you create a promise handle you register its then ( ... ) and catchError ( ... ) and then you use it to handle a callback .
56304	Removes the specified action listener so that it no longer receives action events from this list . Action events occur when a user double-clicks on a list item . If listener < code > l < /code > is < code > null < /code > , no exception is thrown and no action is performed . < p > Refer to < a href= '' doc-files/AWTThreadIssues.html # ListenersThreads '' > AWT Threading Issues < /a > for details on AWT 's threading model .
56323	This method is called when an error happens while replaying an operation . It is necessary because the postOperation does not always get called when error or Exceptions happen during the operation replay .
56325	Advances the position until after the next newline character . If the line is terminated by `` \r\n '' , the '\n ' must be consumed as whitespace by the caller .

10840	Orders the IDC to move to a target rotation . This will set the rotational velocity to 0 . If setTargetRotation is called before a previous order has completed , the old order will be interrupted , and rotation will continue to the new order from whatever rotation it was at when interrupted . This method causes the IDC to sweep its rotation between its current rotation , and the target rotation . The target rotation is *NOT* globally relative ; it is instead relative to the rotation of its parent . Consider a carousel with a grandfather clock standing on it . The cabinet and the carousel would be represented with 1 IDC , and the hands of the clock would be each represented with an IDC . Let the carousel be still and at its default position , with the clock facing NORTH . When it is 12 o'clock , the hand will have zero rotation , and when it 's 6 o'clock , the hand will have half a turn around the NORTH axis . Using this method to order rotations between 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock will have the natural , desired effect . However , using setRotation or setRotationalVelocity can result in the hand not being flush with the face of the clock , since those methods are relative to the world .

21817	GigaSpaces creates static resources implicitly when creating GigaSpaces components , such as remote/embedded space proxies . When using GigaSpaces outside of GigaSpaces containers ( GSC ) and processing unit , in some scenarios this resources should be cleaned up when no longer needed . This is relevant when hosting GigaSpaces components inside other application server which create a new class loader per deployment , which loads GigaSpaces libraries into that class loader each time . When this class loader is unloaded ( Due to undeployment of the application/service ) , this method should be called to cleanup the resources which were created implicitly . This method shutdown GigaSpaces runtime , once invoked the GigaSpaces runtime is destroyed and can not be reused in the current class loader which it was created in , as a result this is an irreversible process . This will only cleanup threads and resources which are created implicitly when using GigaSpaces runtime , it will not clean up resources the user has explicitly created such as space proxies , space instances and other components , this components needs to be destroyed explicitly by the creator . This should only be used when using GigaSpaces runtime outside of GigaSpaces containers ( GSC ) , and only if GigaSpaces libraries are loaded into new class loader on each deployment and not shared across multiple class loaders .

The < code > LeaseListener < /code > argument may be < code > null < /code > . < p > If the < code > lease < /code > argument is < code > null < /code > , a < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown . If the < code > desiredExpiration < /code > argument is < code > Lease.FOREVER < /code > , the < code > renewDuration < /code > argument may be < code > Lease.ANY < /code > or any positive value ; otherwise , the < code > renewDuration < /code > argument must be a positive value . If the < code > renewDuration < /code > argument does not meet these requirements , an < code > IllegalArgumentException < /code > will be thrown . < p > If the lease passed to this method is already in the set of managed leases , the listener object , the desired expiration , and the renewal duration associated with that lease will be replaced with the new listener , desired expiration , and renewal duration . < p > The lease will remain in the set until one of the following occurs : < ul > < li > The lease 's desired or actual expiration time is reached . < li > An explicit removal of the lease from the set is requested via a < code > cancel < /code > , < code > clear < /code > , or < code > remove < /code > call on the renewal manager . < li > The renewal manager tries to renew the lease and gets a bad object exception , bad invocation exception , or < code > LeaseException < /code > . < /ul > < p > This method will interpret the value of the < code > desiredExpiration < /code > argument as the desired absolute system time after which the lease is no longer valid . This argument provides the ability to indicate an expiration time that extends beyond the actual expiration of the lease . If the value passed for this argument does indeed extend beyond the lease 's actual expiration time , then the lease will be systematically renewed at appropriate times until one of the conditions listed above occurs . If the value is less than or equal to the actual expiration time , nothing will be done to modify the time when the lease actually expires . That is , the lease will not be renewed with an expiration time that is less than the actual expiration time of the lease at the time of the call . < p > If the < code > LeaseListener < /code > argument is a non- < code > null < /code > object reference , it will receive notification of exceptional conditions occurring upon a renewal attempt of the lease . In particular , exceptional conditions include the reception of a < code > LeaseException < /code > , bad object exception , or bad invocation exception ( collectively these are referred to as < em > definite exceptions < /em > ) during a renewal attempt or the lease 's actual expiration being reached before its desired expiration . < p > If a definite exception occurs during a lease renewal request , the exception will be wrapped in an instance of the < code > LeaseRenewalEvent < /code > class and sent to the listener . < p > If an indefinite exception occurs during a renewal request for the lease , renewal requests will continue to be made for that lease until : the lease is renewed successfully , a renewal attempt results in a definite exception , or the lease 's actual expiration time has been exceeded . If the lease can not be successfully renewed before its actual expiration is reached , the exception associated with the most recent renewal attempt will be wrapped in an instance of the < code > LeaseRenewalEvent < /code > class and sent to the listener . < p > If the lease 's actual expiration is reached before the lease 's desired expiration time , and either 1 ) the last renewal attempt succeeded or 2 ) there have been no renewal attempts , a < code > LeaseRenewalEvent < /code > containing a < code > null < /code > exception will be sent to the listener .

40448	Computes key.hashCode ( ) and spreads ( XORs ) higher bits of hash to lower . Because the table uses power-of-two masking , sets of hashes that vary only in bits above the current mask will always collide . ( Among known examples are sets of Float keys holding consecutive whole numbers in small tables . ) So we apply a transform that spreads the impact of higher bits downward . There is a tradeoff between speed , utility , and quality of bit-spreading . Because many common sets of hashes are already reasonably distributed ( so do n't benefit from spreading ) , and because we use trees to handle large sets of collisions in bins , we just XOR some shifted bits in the cheapest possible way to reduce systematic lossage , as well as to incorporate impact of the highest bits that would otherwise never be used in index calculations because of table bounds .

55221	Schedules the specified task for repeated < i > fixed-delay execution < /i > , beginning at the specified time . Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals , separated by the specified period . < p > In fixed-delay execution , each execution is scheduled relative to the actual execution time of the previous execution . If an execution is delayed for any reason ( such as garbage collection or other background activity ) , subsequent executions will be delayed as well . In the long run , the frequency of execution will generally be slightly lower than the reciprocal of the specified period ( assuming the system clock underlying < tt > Object.wait ( long ) < /tt > is accurate ) . As a consequence of the above , if the scheduled first time is in the past , it is scheduled for immediate execution . < p > Fixed-delay execution is appropriate for recurring activities that require `` smoothness . '' In other words , it is appropriate for activities where it is more important to keep the frequency accurate in the short run than in the long run . This includes most animation tasks , such as blinking a cursor at regular intervals . It also includes tasks wherein regular activity is performed in response to human input , such as automatically repeating a character as long as a key is held down .

38297	Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it has been loaded into the system . It is always called before the first time that the < code > start < /code > method is called . < p > A subclass of < code > Applet < /code > should override this method if it has initialization to perform . For example , an applet with threads would use the < code > init < /code > method to create the threads and the < code > destroy < /code > method to kill them . < p > The implementation of this method provided by the < code > Applet < /code > class does nothing .

38778	Do nothing
38793	Paints the background of a menu bar .

39040	Adjusts the given row if possible to fit within the layout span . Since all adjustments were already calculated by the LineBreakMeasurer , this is implemented to do nothing .
39042	Normally causes every selected item in the object to be selected if the object supports multiple selections . This method makes no sense in a menu bar , and so does nothing .
39043	Removes the organization names from the list of organization names that can import the service configuration . If the organization has already imported the service configutation , it would have to be undone before the organization name can be removed from the list . The organization names must be fully qualified , starting with a forward slash `` / '' . To specify an entire sub-tree that can use the service configuration , a `` * '' would have to be appended after the final forward slash . For example `` /a/b/c/* '' would imply all sub-organization under `` /a/b/c '' can use this service configuration .

39198	Receive notification of the end of a Namespace mapping . < p > By default , do nothing . Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions at the start of each element ( such as allocating a new tree node or writing output to a file ) . < /p >

40069	Reverses configuration which was done on the specified component during < code > installUI < /code > . This method is invoked when this < code > UIComponent < /code > instance is being removed as the UI delegate for the specified component . This method should undo the configuration performed in < code > installUI < /code > , being careful to leave the < code > JComponent < /code > instance in a clean state ( no extraneous listeners , look-and-feel-specific property objects , etc. ) . This should include the following : < ol > < li > Remove any UI-set borders from the component . < li > Remove any UI-set layout managers on the component . < li > Remove any UI-added sub-components from the component . < li > Remove any UI-added event/property listeners from the component . < li > Remove any UI-installed keyboard UI from the component . < li > Nullify any allocated instance data objects to allow for GC . < /ol >
40085	Processes any key events that the component itself recognizes . This is called after the focus manager and any interested listeners have been given a chance to steal away the event . This method is called only if the event has not yet been consumed . This method is called prior to the keyboard UI logic . < p > This method is implemented to do nothing . Subclasses would normally override this method if they process some key events themselves . If the event is processed , it should be consumed .

40622	Justify this layout . Overridden by subclassers to control justification ( if there were subclassers , that is ... ) The layout will only justify if the paragraph attributes ( from the source text , possibly defaulted by the layout attributes ) indicate a non-zero justification ratio . The text will be justified to the indicated width . The current implementation also adjusts hanging punctuation and trailing whitespace to overhang the justification width . Once justified , the layout may not be rejustified . < p > Some code may rely on immutablity of layouts . Subclassers should not call this directly , but instead should call getJustifiedLayout , which will call this method on a clone of this layout , preserving the original .

41255	Adds the organization names to the list of organization names that can import this service configutation . If one does not exist it will be created . The organization names must be fully qualified , starting with a forward slash `` / '' . To specify an entire sub-tree that can use the service configuration , a `` * '' would have to be appended after the final forward slash . For example `` /a/b/c/* '' would imply all sub-organization under `` /a/b/c '' can use this service configuration . Exporting implies privileges to read the service configuration data and not to modify or delete .
41321	Subclass friendly method to add error handling when a permit is n't granted .
41409	Invoked when a window is activated .
41432	Adds the specified component to the layout . Not used by this class .

42567	For compilation support , we need the option of overwriting ( rather than appending to ) previous composition . We could phase out the old API in favor of this one , but I 'm holding off until we 've made up our minds about compilation . ADDED 9/5/2000 to support compilation experiment . NOTE : GLP 29-Nov-00 I 've left this method in so that CompilingStylesheetHandler will compile . However , I 'm not sure why it 's needed or what it does and I 've commented out the body .

44516	It is very important that sub-classes implement this if they contain any references to the activity ( anything in the view hierarchy etc. ) .

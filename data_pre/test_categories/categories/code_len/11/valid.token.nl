Therefore , it is necessary to always return < code > true < /code > to indicate the user has not failed authentication. < /p > < p > There are two cases : < /p > < ul > < li > without SingleSignon : a Session instance does not yet exist and there is no < code > auth-method < /code > to authenticate the user , so leave Request 's Principal as null . Note : AuthenticatorBase will later examine the security constraints to determine whether the resource is accessible by a user without a security Principal and Role ( i.e . unauthenticated ) . < /li > < li > with SingleSignon : if the user has already authenticated via another container ( using its own login configuration ) , then associate this Session with the SSOEntry so it inherits the already-established security Principal and associated Roles . Note : This particular session will become a full member of the SingleSignOnEntry Session collection and so will potentially keep the SSOE `` alive '' , even if all the other properly authenticated Sessions expire first ... until it expires too . < /li > < /ul >

46351	Creates license key from key in configuration .
46398	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object . It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy ( ) to avoid resource leaks . Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid . Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST . It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained .

49186	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object . It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy ( ) to avoid resource leaks . Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid .

The boolean `` log '' is used to determine if the DN is written to the log file for the background thread to pick up . This value is set to false if the background thread is processing changes . If this method is being called by a delete post operation , then setting the `` log '' value to false will cause the DN to be processed in foreground < p > If the DN is to be processed , than each base DN or public naming context ( if the base DN configuration is empty ) is checked to see if entries under it contain references to the deleted entry DN that need to be removed .

55025	< p > Receives an HTTP HEAD request from the protected < code > service < /code > method and handles the request . The client sends a HEAD request when it wants to see only the headers of a response , such as Content-Type or Content-Length . The HTTP HEAD method counts the output bytes in the response to set the Content-Length header accurately . < p > If you override this method , you can avoid computing the response body and just set the response headers directly to improve performance . Make sure that the < code > doHead < /code > method you write is both safe and idempotent ( that is , protects itself from being called multiple times for one HTTP HEAD request ) . < p > If the HTTP HEAD request is incorrectly formatted , < code > doHead < /code > returns an HTTP `` Bad Request '' message .

55500	Finds a free server socket port on the local host .
55501	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object .

Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid .

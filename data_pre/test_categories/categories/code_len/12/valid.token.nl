28770	Discards the registrar referenced in this class from either the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > or < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > utility employed by this < code > LookupDiscoveryManager < /code > . The utility from which that registrar is discarded is dependent on whether the registrar was previously discovered via group or both group and locator discovery , or via locator discovery alone . This method enables a mechanism for sequentially `` chaining '' the discard process of the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > utility with the discard process of the < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > . That is , rather than discarding the registrar from both utilities at the same time , by invoking this method , the registrar will be discarded from only one of those utilities . Then when the discarded event is received by the listener registered with the utility from which the registrar was discarded , the listener - based on the current discovered state of the registrar - determines whether to : discard the registrar from the other utility , send a discarded event out to the client 's listener , or simply update state and do nothing more . This chaining mechanism helps to present a single event source to the client listeners . That is , even though the two discovery utilities used internally by this < code > LookupDiscoveryManager < /code > operate independently , sending discarded events to the group discovery listener and/or the locator discovery listener , this chaining mechanism enables the coordination of those separate events so that only one event is sent to the client listeners , even though multiple events may have been received here . Although this chaining mechanism is helpful in coordinating the discarded events received from the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > and < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > utilities , the actual reason it must be used is due to the fact that < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > can send a certain type of discarded event - referred to as `` passive communication discard '' ; whereas < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > can not . Recall that < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > monitors the registrars it has discovered for reachability , whereas < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > does not . When the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > sends a passive communication discard because it has determined that one of its registrars has become unreachable , if that registrar was also discovered via locator discovery , it is necessary to discard the registrar from the < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > as well . In that case , this method is called to create a discard chain which ultimately will result in the registrar being discarded from the < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > .

This then allows composite advices to work correctly .
46857	Calls the UI delegate 's paint method , if the UI delegate is non- < code > null < /code > . We pass the delegate a copy of the < code > Graphics < /code > object to protect the rest of the paint code from irrevocable changes ( for example , < code > Graphics.translate < /code > ) . < p > If you override this in a subclass you should not make permanent changes to the passed in < code > Graphics < /code > . For example , you should not alter the clip < code > Rectangle < /code > or modify the transform . If you need to do these operations you may find it easier to create a new < code > Graphics < /code > from the passed in < code > Graphics < /code > and manipulate it . Further , if you do not invoker super 's implementation you must honor the opaque property , that is if this component is opaque , you must completely fill in the background in a non-opaque color . If you do not honor the opaque property you will likely see visual artifacts . < p > The passed in < code > Graphics < /code > object might have a transform other than the identify transform installed on it .

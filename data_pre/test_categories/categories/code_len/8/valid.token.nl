If you create a temporary destination and specify it as the value of the JMSReplyTo message header field when you send a message , the consumer of the message can use the value of the JMSReplyTo field as the destination to which it sends a reply and can also reference the original request by setting the JMSCorrelationID header field of the reply message to the value of the JMSMessageID header field of the request .

25700	We use the same space proxy we obtained in the session and we write another External Entry , which will have a class name of 'TempQueue ' . The only message consumers that can consume from a temporary destination are those created by the same connection that created the destination . Any message producer can send to the temporary destination . If you close the connection that a temporary destination belongs to , the destination is closed and its contents lost . You can use temporary destinations to implement a simple request/reply mechanism . If you create a temporary destination and specify it as the value of the JMSReplyTo message header field when you send a message , the consumer of the message can use the value of the JMSReplyTo field as the destination to which it sends a reply and can also reference the original request by setting the JMSCorrelationID header field of the reply message to the value of the JMSMessageID header field of the request .

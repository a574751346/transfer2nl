15197	The dependent loader logic goes like this : < p/ > 1 . In cursor thread put items in stripes on queue and increment the counter . 2 . In cursor thread finish cursor , decrement count by one completed task and signal that task completed . 3 . In consumer thread pick up stripes from the queue , check if items are not duplicates with FullUniqueIndex and add them to index if necessary 4 . Increment count by number of added items 5 . Decrement count by number of items removed from the stripe . < p/ > The problem happens when # 2 is the end of the last scheduled task . At this point we fire notify . The count is still positive because we added something to the stripes . After this we pick items from the stripes and check on the FullUniqueIndex , but coincidentally the index already has all the elements and these are duplicates . So we add 0 at # 4 and deduct all items from the stripe at # 5 . The count=0 but we do not have any tasks to execute and nobody will notify the engine to get out of wait .

48073	Helper method to check if a property is protected or not . We introduce a mechanism to protect certain `` core '' or `` internal '' properties from updates via remote SetProperty method of the SessionService . Allowing remote self-updates to session properties leads to a security vulnerability which allows unconstrained user impersonation or privilege elevation . See bug # 4814922 for more information protectedProperties contains a set of property names which can not be remotely updated . It is initially populated using static initializer . We also implemented an extra safety mechanism intended to protect from accidental reopening of this security hole in the future if a property name changes or new property is introduced without corresponding update of the static hardcoded list of protected properties below . This mechanism automatically adds any property to protectedProperties if it is set via local invocation of putProperty . However , some properties ( such as Locale and CharSet ) must be settable both locally and remotely . In order to make it configurable we use a second table called remotelyUpdateableProperties . Note that protectedProperties takes precedence over remotelyUpdateableProperties : remotelyUpdateableProperties will be consulted only if a property is not on the protectedProperties list already . The following tables defines the behavior of putProperty ( ) and putExternalProperty ( ) depending on whether property name is present in protectedProperties or remotelyUpdateableProperty list protectedProperties remotelyUpdateableProperties putProperty ( ) putExternalProperty ( ) in n/a sets value logs , does nothing out in sets value sets value out out sets value and sets value adds to protectedProperty

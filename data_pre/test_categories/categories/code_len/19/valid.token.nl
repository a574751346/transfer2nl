27723	Code processor should be created ones at start . But processor creation is not guarantee that classifier is available . Not trained classifier is not ready to use & must be trained soon as possible . The main cases why code processor is not available is : 1 ) processor is not created yet & classifier not trained 2 ) processor created , but occurs an error on classifier train 3 ) processor created , classifier start train , but not finished ( 3rd case is ok , it 's temporary unavailability & awaiting for training ) In 3rd case , user awaiting for train accomplish to get code processor and then take classifier to perform language classifying ( see below ) .
29991	This is a refactored version of Literal.parseLong which supports binary literals . This version of parseLong is implemented as an attribute rather than a static method . Perhaps some slight performance boost could be gained from keeping it static , but with the loss of declarative- and ReRAGness . There exists only a parseLong , and not a parseInteger . Parsing of regular integer literals works the same , but with stricter bounds requirements on the resulting parsed value .

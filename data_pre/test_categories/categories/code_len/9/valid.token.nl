16876	Main working method . You may be surprised that here , just 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' is called . But internally , it works like this : AudioSystem.write ( ) contains a loop that is trying to read from the passed AudioInputStream . Since we have a special AudioInputStream that gets its data from a TargetDataLine , reading from the AudioInputStream leads to reading from the TargetDataLine . The data read this way is then written to the passed File . Before writing of audio data starts , a header is written according to the desired audio file type . Reading continues untill no more data can be read from the AudioInputStream . In our case , this happens if no more data can be read from the TargetDataLine . This , in turn , happens if the TargetDataLine is stopped or closed ( which implies stopping ) . ( Also see the comment above . ) Then , the file is closed and 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' returns .

26576	Main working method . You may be surprised that here , just 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' is called . But internally , it works like this : AudioSystem.write ( ) contains a loop that is trying to read from the passed AudioInputStream . Since we have a special AudioInputStream that gets its data from a TargetDataLine , reading from the AudioInputStream leads to reading from the TargetDataLine . The data read this way is then written to the passed File . Before writing of audio data starts , a header is written according to the desired audio file type . Reading continues untill no more data can be read from the AudioInputStream . In our case , this happens if no more data can be read from the TargetDataLine . This , in turn , happens if the TargetDataLine is stopped or closed ( which implies stopping ) . ( Also see the comment above . ) Then , the file is closed and 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' returns .

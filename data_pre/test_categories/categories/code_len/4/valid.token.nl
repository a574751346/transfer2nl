4293	NOTE : the semantic of forName0 follows forName method . Returns the Class object associated with the class or interface with the given string name , using the given class loader . Given the fully qualified name for a class or interface ( in the same format returned by getName ) this method attempts to locate , load , and link the class or interface . The specified class loader is used to load the class or interface . If the parameter loader is null , the class is loaded through the bootstrap class loader . The class is initialized only if the initialize parameter is true and if it has not been initialized earlier . If name denotes a primitive type or void , an attempt will be made to locate a user-defined class in the unnamed package whose name is name . Therefore , this method can not be used to obtain any of the Class objects representing primitive types or void . If name denotes an array class , the component type of the array class is loaded but not initialized . For example , in an instance method the expression : Class.forName ( `` Foo '' ) is equivalent to : Class.forName ( `` Foo '' , true , this.getClass ( ) .getClassLoader ( ) ) private static native java.lang.Class forName0 ( java.lang.String , boolean , java.lang.ClassLoader ) throws java.lang.ClassNotFoundException ;

10110	Insert Redundant Casts -- . Insert extra casts for the Java bytecode verifier . If the target method uses its this parameter , a reference to the receiver object must be passed to the static copy of the target method . The verifier may complain if the declared type of the receiver parameter does not match the type implementing the target method . Say , for example , that Singer is an interface declaring the sing ( ) method and that the call graph shows all receiver objects at a particular call site , singer.sing ( ) ( with singer declared as a Singer ) are in fact Bird objects ( Bird being a class that implements Singer ) . The virtual call singer.sing ( ) is effectively replaced with the static call Bird.staticsing ( singer ) . Bird.staticsing ( ) may perform operations on its parameter which are only allowed on Birds , rather than Singers . The Insert Redundant Casts option inserts a cast of singer to the Bird type , to prevent complaints from the verifier .

It assumes , for example , that any method call has the potential to write and read all instance and static fields in the program . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and Soot is in whole program mode , then Busy Code Motion uses the side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester class . PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine which fields and statics may be written or read by a given statement . If whole program analysis is not performed , naive side effect information is used regardless of the setting of Naive Side Effect Tester .

26061	MySQL is funny when it comes to timestamps and dates . More specifically , for a DDL statement like 'MYCOLUMN timestamp ( 3 ) ' : - MySQL 5.6.4+ has support for timestamps/dates with millisecond ( or smaller ) precision . The DDL above works and the data in the table will have millisecond precision - MySQL < 5.5.3 allows the DDL statement , but ignores it . The DDL above works but the data wo n't have millisecond precision - MySQL 5.5.3 < [ version ] < 5.6.4 gives and exception when using the DDL above . Also , the 5.5 and 5.6 branches of MySQL are both actively developed and patched . Hence , when doing auto-upgrade/creation of the Activiti tables , the default MySQL DDL file is used and all timestamps/datetimes are converted to not use the millisecond precision by string replacement done in the method below . If using the DDL files directly ( which is a sane choice in production env . ) , there is a distinction between MySQL version < 5.6 .

27614	WARNING ! This requires arbitrary precision arithmetic to be truly robust . This means that for nearly colinear AB and AC , this function may return the wrong answer . < p > Like SimpleCCW ( ) , but returns +1 if the points are counterclockwise and -1 if the points are clockwise . It satisfies the following conditions : ( 1 ) RobustCCW ( a , b , c ) == 0 if and only if a == b , b == c , or c == a ( 2 ) RobustCCW ( b , c , a ) == RobustCCW ( a , b , c ) for all a , b , c ( 3 ) RobustCCW ( c , b , a ) ==-RobustCCW ( a , b , c ) for all a , b , c In other words : ( 1 ) The result is zero if and only if two points are the same . ( 2 ) Rotating the order of the arguments does not affect the result . ( 3 ) Exchanging any two arguments inverts the result . This function is essentially like taking the sign of the determinant of a , b , c , except that it has additional logic to make sure that the above properties hold even when the three points are coplanar , and to deal with the limitations of floating-point arithmetic . Note : a , b and c are expected to be of unit length . Otherwise , the results are undefined .

27641	Format method for the d conversion character and int argument . < p/ > For d format , the flag character '- ' , means that the output should be left justified within the field . The default is to pad with blanks on the left . A '+ ' character means that the conversion will always begin with a sign ( + or - ) . The blank flag character means that a non-negative input will be preceded with a blank . If both a '+ ' and a ' ' are specified , the blank flag is ignored . The ' 0 ' flag character implies that padding to the field width will be done with zeros instead of blanks . < p/ > The field width is treated as the minimum number of characters to be printed . The default is to add no padding . Padding is with blanks by default . < p/ > The precision , if set , is the minimum number of digits to appear . Padding is with leading 0s .

29143	Naive Side Effect Tester -- Use a naive side effect analysis even if interprocedural information is available . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to true , Busy Code Motion uses the conservative side effect information provided by the NaiveSideEffectTester class , even if interprocedural information about side effects is available . The naive side effect analysis is based solely on the information available locally about a statement . It assumes , for example , that any method call has the potential to write and read all instance and static fields in the program . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and Soot is in whole program mode , then Busy Code Motion uses the side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester class . PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine which fields and statics may be written or read by a given statement . If whole program analysis is not performed , naive side effect information is used regardless of the setting of Naive Side Effect Tester .

30841	Insert Redundant Casts -- . Insert extra casts for the Java bytecode verifier . If the target method uses its this parameter , a reference to the receiver object must be passed to the static copy of the target method . The verifier may complain if the declared type of the receiver parameter does not match the type implementing the target method . Say , for example , that Singer is an interface declaring the sing ( ) method and that the call graph shows all receiver objects at a particular call site , singer.sing ( ) ( with singer declared as a Singer ) are in fact Bird objects ( Bird being a class that implements Singer ) . The virtual call singer.sing ( ) is effectively replaced with the static call Bird.staticsing ( singer ) . Bird.staticsing ( ) may perform operations on its parameter which are only allowed on Birds , rather than Singers . The Insert Redundant Casts option inserts a cast of singer to the Bird type , to prevent complaints from the verifier .

Three possibilities exist : < ul > < li > Do not override this method . This makes the subclass use the default implementation , which is to forward the request to the indicated < code > ImageProducer < /code > using this filter as the requesting < code > ImageConsumer < /code > . This behavior is appropriate if the filter can determine that it will forward the pixels in TDLR order if its upstream producer object sends them in TDLR order . < li > Override the method to simply send the data . This is appropriate if the filter can handle the request itself & # 151 ; for example , if the generated pixels have been saved in some sort of buffer . < li > Override the method to do nothing . This is appropriate if the filter can not produce filtered data in TDLR order . < /ul >

43574	Destroys the named context and removes it from the namespace . Any attributes associated with the name are also removed . Intermediate contexts are not destroyed . < p > This method is idempotent . It succeeds even if the terminal atomic name is not bound in the target context , but throws NameNotFoundException if any of the intermediate contexts do not exist . In a federated naming system , a context from one naming system may be bound to a name in another . One can subsequently look up and perform operations on the foreign context using a composite name . However , an attempt destroy the context using this composite name will fail with NotContextException , because the foreign context is not a `` subcontext '' of the context in which it is bound . Instead , use unbind ( ) to remove the binding of the foreign context . Destroying the foreign context requires that the destroySubcontext ( ) be performed on a context from the foreign context 's `` native '' naming system .

46397	This method is called by the OpenAMSessionTokenServerInterceptor and OpenAMSessionTokenClientInterceptor classes when determining whether to assert the TransportToken . The AbstractTokenInterceptor # assertTokens is called in all four JASPI phases . The isTLSInUse implemented in the AbstractTokenInterceptor does not work in the secure-request or validate-response phases - it seems to work exclusively in the validate-request case . The OpenAMSessionToken interceptors need to assert the TransportToken in all four cases to prevent FINE warning messages concerning an unasserted TransportToken , hence this override , which works in all cases . This override will also consult the superclass method . Note however , that there is no state in the outgoing message corresponding to `` http.scheme '' in the server egress message , so the validate-response is not able to assert the TransportToken , and thus the FINE message warning of an unasserted TransportToken will appear . This is really the domain of the TransportBindingHandler ( see http : //cxf.547215.n5.nabble.com/Custom-SecurityPolicy-Assertions-and-the-Symmetric-binding-td5754879.html for details ) , so we will have to live with this error message .

49889	The Android SSLSocket and SSLServerSocket implementations are based on a version of OpenSSL which includes support for RFC 4507 session tickets . When using session tickets , the server does not need to keep a cache mapping session IDs to SSL sessions for reuse . Instead , the client presents the server with a session ticket it received from the server earlier , which is an SSL session encrypted by the server 's secret key . Since in this case the server does not need to keep a cache , some tests may find different results depending on whether or not the session tickets are in use . These tests can use this function to determine if loopback SSL connections are expected to use session tickets and conditionalize their results appropriately .

50734	Returns an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map . The set is backed by the map , so changes to the map are reflected in the set , and vice-versa . If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress , the results of the iteration are undefined . The set supports element removal , which removes the corresponding mapping from the map , via the < tt > Iterator.remove < /tt > , < tt > Set.remove < /tt > , < tt > removeAll < /tt > , < tt > retainAll < /tt > , and < tt > clear < /tt > methods . It does not support the < tt > add < /tt > or < tt > addAll < /tt > methods . < p > < b > While the object returned by this method implements the < tt > Set < /tt > interface , it does < i > not < /i > obey < tt > Set 's < /tt > general contract . Like its backing map , the set returned by this method defines element equality as reference-equality rather than object-equality . This affects the behavior of its < tt > contains < /tt > , < tt > remove < /tt > , < tt > containsAll < /tt > , < tt > equals < /tt > , and < tt > hashCode < /tt > methods. < /b > < p > < b > The < tt > equals < /tt > method of the returned set returns < tt > true < /tt > only if the specified object is a set containing exactly the same object references as the returned set . The symmetry and transitivity requirements of the < tt > Object.equals < /tt > contract may be violated if the set returned by this method is compared to a normal set . However , the < tt > Object.equals < /tt > contract is guaranteed to hold among sets returned by this method. < /b > < p > The < tt > hashCode < /tt > method of the returned set returns the sum of the < i > identity hashcodes < /i > of the elements in the set , rather than the sum of their hashcodes . This is mandated by the change in the semantics of the < tt > equals < /tt > method , in order to enforce the general contract of the < tt > Object.hashCode < /tt > method among sets returned by this method .

Calling seek with a negative index is legal . It sets the current position to -1 to indicate no component and returns false . Passing a non-negative index value for a DynAny that does not have a component at the corresponding position sets the current position to -1 and returns false .

53335	Destroys a DynAny object . This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object . It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy ( ) to avoid resource leaks . Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects ( for example , on objects returned by the current_component operation ) does nothing . Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it . That is , references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid . Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST . It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained .

25144	Decodes the provided encoded schema element ID .
50894	Creates a new `` sharded '' load-balancer which will load-balance individual requests across the provided set of connection factories , each typically representing a single replica , using an algorithm that ensures that requests targeting a given DN will always be routed to the same replica . In other words , this load-balancer increases consistency whilst maintaining read-scalability by simulating a `` single master '' replication topology , where each replica is responsible for a subset of the entries . When a replica is unavailable the load-balancer `` fails over '' by performing a linear probe in order to find the next available replica thus ensuring high-availability when a network partition occurs while sacrificing consistency , since the unavailable replica may still be visible to other clients . < p/ > This load-balancer distributes requests based on the hash of their target DN and handles all core operations , as well as any password modify extended requests and SASL bind requests which use authentication IDs having the `` dn : '' form . Note that subtree operations ( searches , subtree deletes , and modify DN ) are likely to include entries which are `` mastered '' on different replicas , so client applications should be more tolerant of inconsistencies . Requests that are either unrecognized or that do not have a parameter that may be considered to be a target DN will be routed randomly . < p/ > < b > NOTE : < /b > this connection factory returns fake connections , since real connections are obtained for each request . Therefore , the returned fake connections have certain limitations : abandon requests will be ignored since they can not be routed ; connection event listeners can be registered , but will only be notified when the fake connection is closed or when all of the connection factories are unavailable . < p/ > < b > NOTE : < /b > in deployments where there are multiple client applications , care should be taken to ensure that the factories are configured using the same ordering , otherwise requests will not be routed consistently across the client applications . < p/ > The implementation periodically attempts to connect to failed connection factories in order to determine if they have become available again .

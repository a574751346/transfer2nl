19463	Main working method . You may be surprised that here , just 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' is called . But internally , it works like this : AudioSystem.write ( ) contains a loop that is trying to read from the passed AudioInputStream . Since we have a special AudioInputStream that gets its data from a TargetDataLine , reading from the AudioInputStream leads to reading from the TargetDataLine . The data read this way is then written to the passed File . Before writing of audio data starts , a header is written according to the desired audio file type . Reading continues untill no more data can be read from the AudioInputStream . In our case , this happens if no more data can be read from the TargetDataLine . This , in turn , happens if the TargetDataLine is stopped or closed ( which implies stopping ) . ( Also see the comment above . ) Then , the file is closed and 'AudioSystem.write ( ) ' returns .

9138	Appends a new member to the end of this object , with the specified name and the JSON representation of the specified string . < p > This method < strong > does not prevent duplicate names < /strong > . Calling this method with a name that already exists in the object will append another member with the same name . In order to replace existing members , use the method < code > set ( name , value ) < /code > instead . However , < strong > < em > add < /em > is much faster than < em > set < /em > < /strong > ( because it does not need to search for existing members ) . Therefore < em > add < /em > should be preferred when constructing new objects . < /p >

The < code > LeaseListener < /code > argument may be < code > null < /code > . < p > If the < code > lease < /code > argument is < code > null < /code > , a < code > NullPointerException < /code > will be thrown . If the < code > desiredExpiration < /code > argument is < code > Lease.FOREVER < /code > , the < code > renewDuration < /code > argument may be < code > Lease.ANY < /code > or any positive value ; otherwise , the < code > renewDuration < /code > argument must be a positive value .

This argument provides the ability to indicate an expiration time that extends beyond the actual expiration of the lease . If the value passed for this argument does indeed extend beyond the lease 's actual expiration time , then the lease will be systematically renewed at appropriate times until one of the conditions listed above occurs . If the value is less than or equal to the actual expiration time , nothing will be done to modify the time when the lease actually expires . That is , the lease will not be renewed with an expiration time that is less than the actual expiration time of the lease at the time of the call . < p > If the < code > LeaseListener < /code > argument is a non- < code > null < /code > object reference , it will receive notification of exceptional conditions occurring upon a renewal attempt of the lease . In particular , exceptional conditions include the reception of a < code > LeaseException < /code > , bad object exception , or bad invocation exception ( collectively these are referred to as < em > definite exceptions < /em > ) during a renewal attempt or the lease 's actual expiration being reached before its desired expiration . < p > If a definite exception occurs during a lease renewal request , the exception will be wrapped in an instance of the < code > LeaseRenewalEvent < /code > class and sent to the listener . < p > If an indefinite exception occurs during a renewal request for the lease , renewal requests will continue to be made for that lease until : the lease is renewed successfully , a renewal attempt results in a definite exception , or the lease 's actual expiration time has been exceeded . If the lease can not be successfully renewed before its actual expiration is reached , the exception associated with the most recent renewal attempt will be wrapped in an instance of the < code > LeaseRenewalEvent < /code > class and sent to the listener . < p > If the lease 's actual expiration is reached before the lease 's desired expiration time , and either 1 ) the last renewal attempt succeeded or 2 ) there have been no renewal attempts , a < code > LeaseRenewalEvent < /code > containing a < code > null < /code > exception will be sent to the listener .

39598	WARNING ! This requires arbitrary precision arithmetic to be truly robust . This means that for nearly colinear AB and AC , this function may return the wrong answer . < p > Like SimpleCCW ( ) , but returns +1 if the points are counterclockwise and -1 if the points are clockwise . It satisfies the following conditions : ( 1 ) RobustCCW ( a , b , c ) == 0 if and only if a == b , b == c , or c == a ( 2 ) RobustCCW ( b , c , a ) == RobustCCW ( a , b , c ) for all a , b , c ( 3 ) RobustCCW ( c , b , a ) ==-RobustCCW ( a , b , c ) for all a , b , c In other words : ( 1 ) The result is zero if and only if two points are the same . ( 2 ) Rotating the order of the arguments does not affect the result . ( 3 ) Exchanging any two arguments inverts the result . This function is essentially like taking the sign of the determinant of a , b , c , except that it has additional logic to make sure that the above properties hold even when the three points are coplanar , and to deal with the limitations of floating-point arithmetic . Note : a , b and c are expected to be of unit length . Otherwise , the results are undefined .

11541	Discards the registrar referenced in this class from either the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > or < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > utility employed by this < code > LookupDiscoveryManager < /code > . The utility from which that registrar is discarded is dependent on whether the registrar was previously discovered via group or both group and locator discovery , or via locator discovery alone . This method enables a mechanism for sequentially `` chaining '' the discard process of the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > utility with the discard process of the < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > . That is , rather than discarding the registrar from both utilities at the same time , by invoking this method , the registrar will be discarded from only one of those utilities . Then when the discarded event is received by the listener registered with the utility from which the registrar was discarded , the listener - based on the current discovered state of the registrar - determines whether to : discard the registrar from the other utility , send a discarded event out to the client 's listener , or simply update state and do nothing more . This chaining mechanism helps to present a single event source to the client listeners . That is , even though the two discovery utilities used internally by this < code > LookupDiscoveryManager < /code > operate independently , sending discarded events to the group discovery listener and/or the locator discovery listener , this chaining mechanism enables the coordination of those separate events so that only one event is sent to the client listeners , even though multiple events may have been received here . Although this chaining mechanism is helpful in coordinating the discarded events received from the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > and < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > utilities , the actual reason it must be used is due to the fact that < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > can send a certain type of discarded event - referred to as `` passive communication discard '' ; whereas < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > can not . Recall that < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > monitors the registrars it has discovered for reachability , whereas < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > does not . When the < code > LookupDiscovery < /code > sends a passive communication discard because it has determined that one of its registrars has become unreachable , if that registrar was also discovered via locator discovery , it is necessary to discard the registrar from the < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > as well . In that case , this method is called to create a discard chain which ultimately will result in the registrar being discarded from the < code > LookupLocatorDiscovery < /code > .

6047	Naive Side Effect Tester -- Use a naive side effect analysis even if interprocedural information is available . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to true , Busy Code Motion uses the conservative side effect information provided by the NaiveSideEffectTester class , even if interprocedural information about side effects is available . The naive side effect analysis is based solely on the information available locally about a statement . It assumes , for example , that any method call has the potential to write and read all instance and static fields in the program . If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and Soot is in whole program mode , then Busy Code Motion uses the side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester class . PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine which fields and statics may be written or read by a given statement . If whole program analysis is not performed , naive side effect information is used regardless of the setting of Naive Side Effect Tester .

40355	Insert Redundant Casts -- . Insert extra casts for the Java bytecode verifier . If the target method uses its this parameter , a reference to the receiver object must be passed to the static copy of the target method . The verifier may complain if the declared type of the receiver parameter does not match the type implementing the target method . Say , for example , that Singer is an interface declaring the sing ( ) method and that the call graph shows all receiver objects at a particular call site , singer.sing ( ) ( with singer declared as a Singer ) are in fact Bird objects ( Bird being a class that implements Singer ) . The virtual call singer.sing ( ) is effectively replaced with the static call Bird.staticsing ( singer ) . Bird.staticsing ( ) may perform operations on its parameter which are only allowed on Birds , rather than Singers . The Insert Redundant Casts option inserts a cast of singer to the Bird type , to prevent complaints from the verifier .
